Welcome to my tech blog.  My name is Jeff DeWall and I'm a software engineer who grew up in California and then moved out to Vienna, Austria for fun and adventure with my wife.  I've mostly worked as an embedded software engineer on custom platforms and lately on Android and iOS devices.  Professionally I've worked mostly with C# and C++ with a handful of Python, Java and Objective-C thrown in for good measure.

On this site I'll be writing about predominantly programming and development related topics, but I'm also a big fan of language learning and retro video games, so those topics will come up pretty often as well.  In particular I'm a fan of the German language, which is one of the reasons my wife and I chose Austria as a destination to move to, but I'm also currently learning French and Greek, to varying levels of success.

A taste of some upcoming article ideas I have:

- Talk about some of the apps I've been writing using Xamarin.Forms and some of the issues I've encountered
- Some tips and tricks I've come across file implementing an API using Flask for the first time.
- Hacking Final Fantasy 1 on the NES
- Using old adventure games to aid in learning a language
