I'm using  Hugo and there are some straight-forward instructions for creating a bare-bones site and deploying it to a project: Hosting Hugo on GitLab\nI did run into one problem though that I wanted to share with the inter-tubes.  When I first pushed my one-post-blog project to test, I wasn't able to see anything and I just got back the GitLab 404 page.  I tried accessing the site both through http and https but that wasn't the problem.\nMy next step was to download the artifacts from the GitLab CI and when looking at the files generated, I didn't have any html files, just an index.xml and a site.xml.  A quick google turned up that this was likely due to the theme not being setup.\nMy problem was that I followed the standard Hugo tutorial practice of cloning a chosen theme under my blog's themes directory, which meant when I pushed my blog to the GitLab repo, they were just checked in as sub-modules.  That means the files for the theme themselves are not checked into my repo and I only had a commit hash associated with each theme diretory.\nI use git for all of my professional as well as personal projects, but I've never had to deal with submodules.  Typically people just say \"Don't use sub-modules, they're not the solution.\"\nIn this particular case, submodules work pretty cleanly for pulling in themes though, so some quick looking around and all I had to do was create a .gitmodules file in the root of my blog project that shows the mapping of the theme directory to a repo address that can be pulled from.  I had a few different themes I was trying out, so I put all three in there.\n\nThe last step was to add a few steps to the .gitlab-ci.yml so that the submodules were initialized and updated before the hugo generation step is run:\n\nWith that pushed to my repo, the next build quickly succeeded and my blog was up and running!\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/001-setting-up-hugo-blog-on-gitlab/","title":"Setting up a Hugo-based Blog on GitLab"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/002-hacking-final-fantasy-1-on-nes/":{"body":"A few years ago I was inspired to hack around on some of my old favorite NES games after watching the video from Double Fine where the developer Brandon Dillon hacks around on the original Legend of Zelda.  You can watch the video here.\nI decided I wanted to hack Final Fantasy 1, one of my favorite games growing up, that I put in more than 100 hours playing.  I used fceux as my NES emulator, same as in the video and followed mostly the same patterns.\nI kept some notes on how I did it and thought others might find the process as interesting and fun as I did.  I ended up losing most of the notes from a few years ago, so I went back and rediscovered the different memory locations and values to use again.\nI searched in the RAM Search window for values, particularly as something in-game would change, such as when you buy a weapon or a spell, in order to track down the correct memory locations.  Then I would use the Hex Editor tool to look at the NES RAM and try poking different locations.\nNote that values that need more than one byte are stored little-endian, so the lower byte shows up first in memory.\nCharacter Data and Stats\nThe character data is organized into four blocks, once for each character, one after the other starting at 0x6100.  I was able to find this by searching for my character's names in RAM.  The trick is finding the value associated with the letters, which you can do by looking at the PPU memory and determining what tile goes to what letter.\n \nYou can see that a capital 'A' is mapped to 0x8A.  I named my first character 'AAAA' so searching through the Hex Editor in FCEUX for the hex \"8a8a8a8a\" brings us right to the first character's block of data:\n \nAddressCharacter Data\n0x6100 - 0x613f1st character\n0x6140 - 0x617f2nd character\n0x6180 - 0x61bf3rd character\n0x61c0 - 0x61ff4th character\n\nSome interesting locations within a character block:\nAddressAttribute\n0x0character type\n0x1character alive state (0: alive, 1:dead)\n0x2 - 0x5character name (using PPU tile indices)\n0x7 - 0x9experience points\n0xa - 0xbcurrent hit points\n0xc - 0xdmax hit points\n0x10 - 0x14Str, Agl, Int, Vit, Luck\n0x20 - 0x23Damage, Hit%, Absorb, Evade %\n\nI found many of the above locations by looking at the Stats section for a character and then looking for the hex converted values within the block.  For instance, looking for my first character's Str and Agl of 20, and 5 was a matter of looking for the hex values 14, 05 and finding them on the second line of the data block.  Then I messed with the values and saw what changed.\nWhen you start the game, you characters are child versions of their classes: fighter, black mage, etc.  Later in the game, after you get the Rat's Tail, they become adults: knight, black wizard etc.  You can increase the character's type value by 6 (the total number of character classes), and they will change to their adult version right away.\nMagic\nWhat magic spells a character has, and the current/max number of spells per level are stored in blocks for each character starting at 0x6300:\nAddressCharacter Magic Data\n0x6300 - 0x632f1st character\n0x6340 - 0x636f2nd character\n0x6380 - 0x63af3rd character\n0x63c0 - 0x63ef4th character\n\nThe first 32 bytes are what spells the character has for each level.  Each level gets 4 bytes, with the first 3 being the spell in that level's slot, and the 4th byte being 0.  White spells for a level are numbered 0-4 and black spells are 5-8.\nThe last 16 bytes within the block are 2 bytes for each level, with the first byte being the current number of casts left for the level, with the 2nd byte being the max.\nHere you can see a white wizard that I've given the first 3 spells of each level to (the repeating 01 02 03) and that has 9 / 9 casts for each level:\n \nAnd the white wizard's magic table in-game looks like:\n \nWhite Magic Spell table\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nLvl 1 | cure | harm | fog | ruse\nLvl 2 | lamp | mute | alit | invs\nLvl 3 | cur2 | hrm2 | afir | heal\nLvl 4 | pure | fear | aice | amut\nLvl 5 | cur3 | life | hrm3 | hel2\nLvl 6 | soft | exit | fog2 | inv2\nLvl 7 | cur4 | hrm4 | arub | hel3\nLvl 8 | lif2 | fade | wall | xfer\nBlack Magic Spell table\n| 5 | 6 | 7 | 8\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nLvl 1 | fire | slep | lcok | lit\nLvl 2 | ice | dark | tmpr | slow\nLvl 3 | fir2 | hold | lit2 | lok2\nLvl 4 | slp2 | fast | conf | ice2\nLvl 5 | fir3 | bane | warp | slo2\nLvl 6 | lit3 | rub | qake | stun\nLvl 7 | ice3 | brak | sabr | blnd\nLvl 8 | nuke | stop | zap! | xxxx\nWeapons and Armor\nBy buying a rapier and then equipping/unequipping I found the equip memory to be at 0x0300, there are 16 bytes available, matching the 4 slots for each character. Each weapon and armor has a number and to be equipped is a matter of setting the highest bit.  For example, if the rapier is 04, then 84 means an equipped rapier.\nInterestingly, the memory seems to be used for the equip menu, and is mirrored at 0x0b00, 0x1300, and 0x1b00 as well.  This same memory is used when equipping armor, so you can set the values while equipping, and they will stick when you leave the menu.\nWeapons List\nHex CodeWeaponHex CodeWeapon\n00Nothing15Ice Sword\n01Wooden Nunchucks16Dragon sword\n02Small dagger17Giant sword\n03Wooden staff18Sun Sword\n04Rapier19Coral sword\n05Iron Hammer1aWere Sword\n06Short Sword1bRune sword\n07Hand Axe1cPower staff\n08Scimatar1dLight Axe\n09Iron Nunchucks1eHeal staff\n0aLarge Knfie1fMage staff\n0bIron Staff20Defense ?\n0cSabre21Wizard staff\n0dLong Sword22Vorpal\n0eGreat Axe23CatClaw\n0fFalchon24Thor Hammer\n10Silver dagger25Bane Sword\n11Silver Sword26Katana\n12Silver Hammer27XCalber\n13Silver Axe28Masmune\n14Flame sword\n\nArmor List\nHex ValueArmorHex ValueArmor\n01Cloth15Ice shield\n02Wooden Armor16Opal shield\n03Chain Armor17Aegis Shield\n04Iron Armor18Buckler\n05Steel Armor19ProCape\n06Silver Armor1aCap\n07Flame Armor1bWooden helmet\n08Ice Armor1cIron helmet\n09Opal Armor1dSilver helmet\n0ADragon Armor1eOpal helmet\n0bCopper ring1fHeal helmet\n0cSilver ring20Ribbon\n0dGold ring21Gloves\n0eOpal Ring22Copper bracer\n0fWhite Shirt23Iron bracer\n10Black shirt24Silver bracer\n11Wooden shield25Zeus bracer\n12Iron shield26Power bracer\n13Silver shield27Opal bracer\n14Flame shield28ProRing\n\nPlaying around with the values, I ended up with weapons like:\n \nand my armor setup looked like this, although I wasn't trying to find the best setup:\n \nOther Misc Game Data\nI ended up finding some general game data by searching for the gold amount of my party.\nGold is stored in at least 3 bytes at 0x601c - 0x601e (highest byte is 601e).  Setting the value above 0x0F423F (999,999) will cause you to have more gold when buying items, but sometimes the display value can be messed up and display some random letters like 999,9N2.  I didn't dig much more into this as having more gold wasn't necessary.\nMemory location 0x6016, when changed to non-zero, triggers the cut scene when the heroes first cross the bridge after defeating Garland.\nBy writing 1's to the values in the generic game data block.  I narrowed down the light orb booleans to the addresses: 0x6032-0x6035. A zero means the orb has not yet been obtained, and any other values shows the orb as shining.\nThe character's world position: 0x0027 xpos, 0x0028 ypos.  You can teleport the player around by changing these values.  If you do so the map doesn't update automatically, but you'll see the new location tiles scroll in as you start to walk around or you can do a screen refresh by going into the party menu and then leaving.\nIf you teleport onto a location, like a mountain or water, you'll be stuck, but then you just need to teleport yourself by changing the world position some more.\nI wanted to find the airship right away, so I looked at a map online of FF1 and guesstimated where the world pos should be.  I teleported myself in the desert where the airship is, placing myself nearby at 0xD1, 0xE5 for the x and y coordinates respectively.\nThen looking back at the general game data block at 0x6000, I noticed a pair of coordinates DD, ED at 0x6005-0x6006 that looked like they could belong to the airship world position. So I tried setting the values around that to 1 to see if that would enable to the airship and setting the byte just before, which was 0, to 1, caused it to increment to 1f and the airship to appear at 0xDD, 0xED.\nIn a new game, you could simply move the airship to your world position and enable it and it will appear right next to you.\nWrapping up\nThis was a fun way to spend a few hours on a rainy Saturday revisiting one of my favorite games from my youth without investing as many hours playing.  It does make me feel a bit less inclined to play old RPGs now, knowing that I'm grinding just to increase a few bytes of memory.\nI hope you've found this interesting and try hacking around on an old game from your past and share the details.  Happy hacking!\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/002-hacking-final-fantasy-1-on-nes/","title":"Hacking Final Fantasy 1 on the NES"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/005-elixir-on-wsl/":{"body":"Lately I've been doing a lot of elixir and phoenix programming while working on some hobby projects.  I'm using a phoenix app as my backend server, serving up an API that is consumed by Xamarin.Forms based apps on Android and iOS.\nOn Windows I've been using Git Bash (based on MinGW) for a bash shell for a long time and there the interactive elixir shell has had some downsides.  In particular, I wasn't able to get command history with iex working and color output was missing as well.  Now with the Linux Subsystem for Windows available, also called WSL, you can get the best of linux development on your Windows machine.\nWhile initially trying elixir development using the linux version on Windows, I was worried how I might access the Erlang observer or debugger, which require GUIs, but with an extra X Server started, you can get it working without any problems.\nInstalling WSL and Elixir\nYou can follow the Microsoft documentation for installing WSL\nSoon you'll be able to choose the linux distro you want to install (Insider builds already can), but I'm using the vanilla Ubunutu install.\nWith your shiny real Ubuntu bash prompt, you can then install any packages you need with apt-get.  For elixir run the following:\n\nNote that this will install a bunch of GTK dependencies which are part of showing the Erlang debugger and observer.\nIf you run iex and try to start the observer, you'll see the following (Note: I've modified the formatting for the blog a bit):\n\nInstalling an X Server\nTo fix this we need to install an X Server on Windows which can draw our GUIs and let the terminal know about it.\nThe VcXSrv project is an implementation that I've been using that works quite well: VcXSrv\nWith the VcXSrv started you'll have an icon in your tray to let you know it's running but we still need to let WSL know about it by exporting the display variable:\n\nWith that set, you can start the observer or debugger from iex:\n\n \n\n \nBetter color and copy/paste support: WSLtty\nI am used to using ctrl+ins and shift+ins for copying/pasting from the shell but I wasn't able to get this working in the vanilla Bash on Windows.  Luckily there is a mintty based project called wsltty that works perfectly with WSL.  Using wsltty I now have full 256 color support and ctrl+ins/shirt+ins pasting.  You can grab wsltty from\nWSLtty Project\nThen rather than the normal shortcut You can use the WSLtty one.  There are a few variants but I use: 'WSL Bash % in Mintty'\nSome config steps for WSL\nSince WSLtty is based on mintty, you can use a mintty config file to setup nicer colors.  I use a monokai-ish like color scheme.  You can place the following config options in the file: c:\\Users\\&lt;Your User Name&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\wsltty\\config\n\nYou'll end up with a terminal that looks like this:\n \n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/005-elixir-on-wsl/","title":"Elixir on Windows Subsystem for Linux"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/006-phoenix-fallback-controller-note/":{"body":"Just a quick note this time.

Similar to (formatted excerpt):\n\nMy route looked to be setup correctly and I couldn't figure out why I was hitting the fallback controller at all.  It turned out the problem was one branch of my controller for that route didn't return a Plug.Conn and so my project fell back to the FallbackController.  Of course the Fallback controller didn't know what to do with my nil return value either, hence the error.\nIn any case, now knowing that that can occur, I was able to avoid spending too much time checking that my route was spelled correctly and such, instead looking to see that all the branches have a valid render call.

For instance, I want my normal build to point to the production server, but when I'm developing locally I want a different app that points to my local dev backend.  I still want to be able to use the current production app and have a development version installed at the same time.\nPart of the problem I had with a single apk, is that I would forget which version was installed and not remember which server I was pointing to when using the app.\nI started working on a solution for iOS as well, but it would involve a script to swap out the Info.plist while as a pre-build step.  Since I do most of my development on my Windows machine with Android, I've left the iOS fix for later.\nSetting up Visual Studio for Multiple Android Builds\nThe first step is to have different build configurations in Visual Studio so that we can differentiate between the different apks that we want to build.  First, I went to Build -&gt; Configuration Manahger and then I selected that I wanted to create a new configuration, copying the Debug configuration.\nWe can use the configuration not only to have configuration specific preprocessor flags that we use in our code, but we can conditionally include files by configuration with MSBuild, even though some options are not always available in Visual Studio's UI.\nThere are two things that we want for different build configurations: A different package name so that Android can differentiate between our builds and a different label so that we can.\nThe first step is to create Android manifests for each configuration:\n\nCreate copies of your AndroidManifest, naming them so that you can identify which one belongs to which configuration.\nFor Instance, I create a LocalDev configuration, so I have an AndroidManifest.LocalDev.manifest.\nAdd a new package name in your copied manifest's manifest element\nAdd a different label to the application element so we can differentiate when looking at the launcher which apk is which.\n\nHere's my full LocalDev AndroidManifest:\n\nThe second step is to set MSBuild to use our new Android Manifest in the new build configuration.  You can do this by editing your App's Android .csproj in a text editor.  Notice that the PropertyGroup for each configuration can add its own element for the AndroidManifest to use.\n\nMy .csproj configuration PropertyGroup block for my LocalDev build configuration looks like:\n\nNote: the actual manifest that is included in your app's apk is created using this manifest file as a base and then merging in class attribute related information to create a final version.  The attributes take precedence, so if you have a label set on your activity or application class through an attribute, that will negate what you've placed in your manifest file.\nCheck the following Xamarin article for more details: Working with Android Manifest\nFinal thoughts\nA downside with this approach is that you now have to work to keep your different manifests in sync for the pieces that do show up in there.\nAs I mentioned in the beginning I'm looking to make a script for iOS builds to do the same thing.  This would be applicable to Android as well and allow you to have just a template manifest that is used to generate the correct configuration manifest as a prebuild step.\nThe open question there is if the generated manifest gets picked up properly on configuration swaps or if a cached version is used, etc.  Seeing as how the process above has been working really well for me so far, the iOS version has a been a lower priority on my task list.\nI hope this can help some other developers out there as well to get around the prod/dev apk issue I was hitting.\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/007-multiple-android-builds-xamarin-forms/","title":"Multiple Android builds on Xamarin Forms"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/008-letsencrypt-with-hugo/":{"body":"I finally got around to setting up HTTPS with a free TLS certificate for the blog.

In particular Let's Encrypts' tool letsencrypt-auto won't work under WSL.  It seems to be due to a python package trying to execute code on the stack, which is a security vulnerability that WSL disallows, according to this github issue.\nI ended up creating a simple virtual machine with Vagrant in order to run let's encrypt and get a certificate generated.  It actually took me longer than I originally expected, given that there are quite a few articles on setting this up.  I followed this article that talks specifically about GitLab, where this blog is hosted.

I didn't start out being good at learning languages.  In fact I was pretty terrible.  I'm not a polyglot or anything, but you tend to hear that same sentiment from most people online that have learned a second langage later in life.  For instance, I took four years of Spanish in high-school but could still barely order a taco and a drink when push came to shove.\nIt wasn't until I was in College and needed to take a series of electives that I stumbled upon the idea of trying a foreign language more seriously.  I had always heard that you can't learn a language after about the age of ten, because, you know, scientific reason about the brain and neurons.  I decided to give it a try anyways.\nI had given a few feeble attempts at learning Japanese while in high school, but had always stumbled on learning the various characters; I just couldn't quite crack the system to memorize all of the kanji and it seemed downright impossible.  I had also always been interested in German, since some of my family traced its roots back there.  In the end, having a full Computer Science degree course load, I decided to try the language that both suited my fancy and seemed at least surmountable: German.\nIt turned out my college courses in German were really good: the class was actually conducted in German and it forced me to actually try to use the vocabulary that I was learning.  On top of that I supplemented my learning with some great audio resources: Pimsleur and, my favorite (even to this day): the Michel Thomas German series.  Suddenly I was able to handle basic conversations and through that gained confidence that I could actually learn a foreign language.\nMy next step towards learning to love learning languages was a semester abroad in Potsdam, Germany.  It was, for me, a turning point in my life where I really got a chance to grow into an individual.  I made a number of great friends that I still am in close contact with to this day and it spurred me on to keep learning, eventually reading through all of the Harry Potter books auf Deutsch.\nBack in June 2017, I saw that Duolingo opened up the beta for their Japanese course and I decided to give it a shot.  I got hooked on it, but like most Duolingo courses, it only can go into so much depth and I started to get an itch to dig deeper.  Looking for resources on the internet I was amazed at how many fantastic resources there are for Japanese.  In particular I stumbled upon NihongoShark's website and decided to try out the Hacking Japanese Supercourse after checking out the free newsletters for a few weeks.\nOne key piece of advice early on was to break up learning the kanji into multiple phases.  I had always tried to learn not just the meaning, but the different pronunciations at the same time.  In this book, it was saying forget that, just learn all of the meanings first, then learn vocabulary and you'll get the reading through that.  The readings on their own aren't that valuable when you aren't guaranteed to know which one to use given a particular word anyway.\nI started in November in earnest, working through the Jouyou kanji; the set of 2136 kanji that cover the kanji used in Japanese newspapers.  Ones outside that list are pretty rare apparently and if they do show up, the use the furigana to let you know how the kanji is to be pronounced.\nI worked through 20 new kanji a day, reviewing 100 at first and then upping that to 120 after a month or two when I found I wasn't seeing old kanji often enough.  I did this every day, usually before bed, and it took on average 45 minutes per day.  I managed to stick with it even though I got a number of colds and the flu during this winter season.\nBy being consistent with my practice and never breaking the chain of days, I've now reached my goal of having seen all of the kanji in the NihongoShark Anki deck.  That doesn't mean I've learned them all perfectly yet, but it's the first big step into finally learning the language that I've always dreamed of being able to speak and read.\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/009-learning-japanese-kanji/","title":"Learning the Jouyou Kanji"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/010-classic-techbooks-at-archive-org/":{"body":"I've been away from blogging for a few months and haven't had much time for personal projects either.  I recently moved from Vienna back to the US, now living in Denver.  So far I'm loving it; it's nice to come back after a number of years abroad, even if I will miss many parts of life in Europe.\nGetting into Electronics\nI've recently gotten into electronics more deeply than I've had a chance to do before.  I took a number of EE courses in college, but didn't have much of a chance to apply it since I went into software development.  There are some amazing resources online nowadays for getting started or increasing your knowledge.\nFor starters, there are some great channels on YouTube.  The one that really got me into things was EEVBlog.  I recently followed most of the recommendations on setting up an electronics lab from a video of that is a few years old.  Some of the links are outdated now, but the items are easy enough to find.\nA close second for piquing my interest was the series of videos from Ben Eater about building an 8-bit CPU from discrete chips.  I'm planning on doing my own build of Ben Eater's CPU, although I will likely make some changes like increase the amount of memory\nThirdly, I love watching the repair videos from Retro Man Cave's channel.  They got me excited about actually pulling apart old systems and being able to diagnose real issues and fix them.\nClassic Technical books\nI stumbled upon a trove of amazing old technical books on archive.org recently.  I had poked around a bit before, but never thought about looking for some classics that I'd been wanting to read.\nFor instance, you can find The Art of Electronics 2nd Edition, which is a classic book that you hear recommended by many folks.  Even though there is a 3rd edition that was published a few years ago, the 2nd still gets high marks for sections on good versus bad circuits at the end of various chapters.\nAnother book I recently heard about and found there was [High Speed Digital Design, a Book of Black Magic] (https://archive.org/details/HighSpeedDigitalDesignJohnsonGraham).  Note that the preview shows the first of four books from the same authors.  The one I'm talknig about here is the fourth in the pdf list.\nI saw a review on Amazon from Bil Herd, an engineer who worked on the Commodore 128 and Plus4, and has videos on Hackaday, talking about this being one of his favorite books on high speed design.  It's now high on my list of books to read through, sitting comfortably on my iPad.\nI also was able to find the book HDL Chip Design, recommended by Jeri Ellsworth in her video on books for learning FPGA programming, which is another area I've been diving into more deeply.\nI had learned some VHDL in school, but having now discovered Verilog, I'm more interested in playing around with it.  Verilog is a bit cleaner in syntax to me, looking a bit more like C, but as if everything were super multi-threaded.\nSpeaking of C, you can even find the C Programming language 2nd ed, which was the first programming book I ever owned, receiving it as a gift when I was 13.\nNow I've got some reading to get back to, catch you next time!\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/010-classic-techbooks-at-archive-org/","title":"Electronics and great technical books on archive.org"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/011-wx-sfml/":{"body":"I've been working on a project where I wanted to embed an SFML drawing context in a wxWidgets window.  I wanted to be able to write a GUI application, but didn't want to have all of the UI be embedded within the SFML window using something like imgui.\nI thought it could be useful to others to have a simple example of how to do the same thing.\nSimple Example version\nI took the code from the SFML 1.6 tutorial here and updated it slightly to work with SFML 2.5 and wxWidgets 3.1.  As part of this I played around with using conan to pull down the SFML and wxWidgets dependencies and integrate them with CMake for generating my build files.\nI've only tested under Windows 10, and have currently commented out the GTK portions, that according to a Stack Overflow question don't work anymore.  I'll need to spend some time trying to build under linux at some point, but that's not a priority for me at the moment.\nI've made a repo on GitLab where you can try building it yourself: https://gitlab.com/sr.jilarious/wx_sfml\nCurrently it's just a simple base class for the SFML canvas, with an overridden implementation that draws a sprite.  I also added a wx button that can change the scale of the sprite to show how the two can work together seamlessly.\n \nMy Level Editor Use Case\nIn my case I'm working on a level editor for a Nintendo simulator.  I want to prototype a game before porting it over to 6502 assembly and run it on the actual NES.  It's a lot faster to iterate on the game logic and see if something is fun if I can just use all the niceties of C++.\nFor the level editor, this means having various controls embedded within a larger GUI, where I want to access portions of my game logic and drawing code using SFML.  For instance, I have a meta-tile editor drawn with SFML where I can build up 2x2 or 4x4 meta-tiles that are built up from the 8x8 pixel tile building blocks available on the NES.  Similarly I have a map editor drawn using SFML with my engine code that lets me lay out meta-tiles in layers to build up maps, place objects, etc.\nBy integrating my engine code with a larger GUI framework, that means I get to have list views, property editors, buttons, menus and everything else with very little extra work.\n \nI'll have more to say about the Nintendo simulator project and the resulting game I'm working on in the future.\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/011-wx-sfml/","title":"Wx 3.1 with embedded SFML 2.5 control"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/012-passive-active-consumption-production/":{"body":"I was thinking recently about the different things I choose to do in my free time and which ones bring me the most enjoyment.  I tend to have too many hobby projects going on at once and every three months or so, I naturally tend to cycle around.\nI realized I enjoyed my time the most when I had something to show for it: a written blog post, a finished circuit on a breadboard, or some module written towards some software project.\nIt dawned on me that you can classify the things you choose to do as consuming or producing activities and that producing something tends to bring more enjoyment and fulfullment.\nBut that doesn't feel like it models things well enough.  You can further classify you activities as passive or active versions of consuming or producing.  For instance, watching TV, reading, or playing a game are all typically passive consumption tasks: you don't need to engage your mind too much to process the content.\nHowever, if you are learning a second language and you watch TV or read a book in that language, you are now actively consuming the material.  You are building a skill while you consume.  You can similarly actively consume material based on how you approach it.  If you are disecting the thesis of a book, or learning some non-fictional material, you are also actively consuming.\nYou can split producing activities into passive and active as well.  I place anything where you are creating something of value, to yourself or someone else, as an active producing one.  I also believe when you are building a skill you are actively producing.  For instance, working out intensely, learning a new instrument or song, or trying to have a discussion in a new language.  Even if what is produced is non-material and simply an experience.\nThe active consuming and producing activities have some overlap, since you can view learning a subject from a book or video as helping to produce whatever skill they are teaching, such as a new programing language, or how to repair something.\nPassive producing activities are where you are not really needing to push yourself, and the results of your actions are not really consumed themselves.  Things like journaling, doing practice sketching, playing songs you know really well on an instrument, or even working out with weights but just not that intensely.\nThe hierarchy of which tasks bring the most fulfillment are passive consumption at the bottom with active consumption blending with passive production and active production being the most fulfilling.  So the next time you have free time on your hands, think about whether you are being actively productive with your time.  Perhaps it will motivate you to work on that side project you've been putting off.\nAnother axis I haven't thought much about is socializing and how that might fit in.  My initial feeling is that it is an orthogonal property of activities and that it brings value in its own right.  I also imagine passive and active socializing making sense.  For instance being around people but not interacting versus having and help driving an interesting conversation.\nFor myself, Breaking my activities into passive/active and cosuming/producing been a useful model to help me allocate time towards my more fulfulling projects the last year. Perhaps others will find it similarly motivating.\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/012-passive-active-consumption-production/","title":"Passive and Active, Consuming and Producing"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/013-bitfeld-widths-cpp/":{"body":"Recently, I learned about a feature in C and C++ that I hadn't run into before: bit widths for fields in structures.  The idea is that you can specify how many bits a particular field should have allocated to it.  For example, you can have a field that is only 5 bits wide and therefore only takes values in [0, 32).  You could then have a field that is 3 bits wide that is placed next to the first field in memory.\nI decided to play around with them a bit, trying to create a packed RGB 565 structure using bitfield widths rather than doing the bitmasking and shifting by hand.  I noticed a couple of interesting things in the process:\n\nIt's implementation dependent as to what order the fields show up; left-to-right or right-to-left in memory.\nIt's implementation dependent as to whether fields span across type size boundaries.\n\nYou can read more in depth details here on cppreference\nAn example\nHere is the code I hacked together to see how it works.  There are three versions of basically the same RGB565 structure, but with minor changes, first with field type, and then with order:\n\nRunning this with GCC 7.4.0 you get:\n\nWhat you see is that the first structure is having each field placed into its own byte, not spanning the g field across the first and second bytes.\nThe second structure shows that the structure is packed little endian on my machine, meaning r is in the lower bits, g in the middle, and b in the upper bits, so actually a BGR565 structure.\nThe last one is what I actually wanted: 16 bits packed tightly together, with red in the upper bits and blue in the bottom.\nSummary\nLetting the compiler do the bitmasking and shifting for you looks like a useful feature on the surface, but I'd be careful to have a unit test when using this in production.  I'd want to make sure that on any particular architecture I build for, that I would get the raw values that I expect so I wouldn't end up with red and blue switched around when changing compilers or targets.\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/013-bitfeld-widths-cpp/","title":"Bitfield widths in C/C++ structures"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/014-fpga-start/":{"body":"Over the last few years I've gotten more interested in electronics and FPGA design.  I've also noticed that a lot of other software folks seem interested in doing the same, but often don't know where to start.  So, I think I have some interesting advice for software engineers that feel like dipping their toes into the hardware world from the point of view of a software engineer.\nIn this post I'll go over FPGAs in general, the basics of the Verilog language, simulating a design and deploying it to an inexpensive TinyFPGA-BX board.\nArticle Series\n\nVerilog and State Machines\nSimulation and Build Tools\nSeven Segment Displays\nDocker Builds\nBuild System Updates, ECP5 Support\nTime-Multiplexed Seven Segment Displays\n\nUpdates Feb 23, 2021\nAs mentioned at the end of this article, I've moved the main repository over to GitHub, so the article has been updated with links to that repo.  I've also switched from tags to branches so that things like the new Docker build system from this article can be added more easily.  The branches follow the format post_N so this post's branch is post_1.\nUpdates Nov 14, 2022\nIn the Build System Updates, ECP5 Support article, I mentioned a number of updates that will change what you see in the repo.  In particular, with ECP5 support and Docker used as the main build system, building looks different, and is much easier in my opinion.\nFor exampe, rather than using make to build blinky below, you would use dev.sh build 00_blinky.\nStarting with FPGAs\nFPGAs, short for Field Programmable Gate Arrays, are chips that contain loads of look up tables that can be programmed such that they can implement digital circuits.  Nowadays they also contain many other devices baked right into the chip, such as RAM blocks, multiplier circuits, and sometimes even whole CPUs with the ability to hook up to the lookup table/logic gates.  These programmable logic gates are sometimes referred to as the programmable fabric of the FPGA.\nThere are many vendors, but Xilinx and Intel (formerly Altera) are the biggest.  Lattice also makes FPGAs and the best part is that due to reverse engineering efforts from project IceStorm there are open source tools for building the binary blob, called a bitstream, that is loaded onto the FPGA.\nFPGAs, like ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuit), are still most often programmed in an HDL (Hardware Description Language).  The two you'll hear about are VHDL and Verilog.  Verilog is a bit more like C and VHDL has an Ada inspired syntax.\nFPGAs are not (typically) programmed in a high level language like C/C++, Python, etc.  There is however work being done to use C++ on FPGAs though with support from the chip vendors themselves.  Using so-called High-Level Synthesis compilers, such as the Vivado HLS or the Intel HLS compiler, #prgama annotated C++ can be compiled into corresponding Verilog or VHDL modules that can then be syntehsized for use on the FPGA.\nOther higher level languages for hardware description exist such as a Scala derived language called Chisel, and a Python based language called Migen although I haven't looked at using either of those personally.\nWhy choose Verilog over VHDL\nI originally learned some VHDL in college and was keen to stay with that rather than learn Verilog.  I eventually bit the bullet and picked up Verilog solely because of the tool Verilator.  It's an open-source simulator and is really great.\nMost of the professional FPGA tools take ages to compile a design compared to what software engineers are used to.  I've had Quartus (Intel's toolset) take a few minutes to compile a couple of modules.  That makes the development cycle really painful.\nVerilator is a tool for taking Verilog code and compiling it into C++ modules in order to do simulation.  The  major benefit is that Verilator takes a couple of seconds to compile the same design that Quartus takes minutes on.  So especially when you're just learning Verilog and need to iterate while learning the syntax, I heavily recommend starting with Verilator.\nYou also write your testbench (think unit/functional test code) in C++ rather that trying to write that in Verilog.  I find writing imperative test code in C++ far easier than doing so in Verilog.\nHaving your code simulated in C++ also opens up some interesting possiblities to mock out portions of the system you want to test.  For example, I was able to create a VGA test pattern generator and simulate it within C++ hooking it up to a mocked VGA monitor that output to an application window using SDL2.\nStarting with Electronics\nAlthough not strictly necessary for what we're doing in this article, you'll need to know some basic electronics as soon as you want to start interfacing to the outside world.  As I mentioned in my article about classic textbooks you can find at archive.org, there are tons of resources online for learning electronics.\nThe first thing to do is grab The Art of Electronics 2nd Edition from archive.org, which is a classic book that you hear recommended by many people.  There you can read up on theory and many practical details too.  The most basic things to know well are Ohm's Law, RC circuits and calculating power.\nIf you're coming in to do digital circuits, you can skip Bipolar Junction Transistors and Op-Amps for now.  They're great to understand, but for blinking an LED or communicating with a device over I2C, they're not strictly necessary.\nVideo-wise I definitely recommend Ben Eater's videos on building a CPU on a breadboard.  It's a great bridge between electronics and the software world.  He describes a lot of practical details like using current limiting resistors to keep your LEDs from burning out.\nI also enjoy watching the EEVBlog.  If you want to try building things yourself, check out his video on setting up an electronics lab for cheap.  It's not totally up to date and some links are broken but you can find replacements easily enough.\nWhere to begin\nBefore we dive into some basics of Verilog, we'll want to install some tools and if we want to test on a real device, determine which one fits our requirements.\n(Software) Tools\nI'll be showing examples in Verilog and simulating them with Verilator.  When simulating a design on the PC, it can useful to see the waveform trace.  The trace is just the state of all signals in the design at each point in time during simulation.\nVerilator can be setup to write out to a standard .vcd format which you can view in GtkWave.\nI typically run Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and do all of my building/simulation in that environment and so I'll be assuming you're using that or Linux and know how to get these tools setup.\nYou'll want to install Verilator from source, following the instructions on its website.\nSome Interesting Boards\nThere are a lot of cheap-ish boards nowadays, such as the DE10-Nano from Terasic which uses an Intel Cyclone V FPGA, or the Arty A7 by Digilent which uses an Artix-7 FPGA from Xilinx.\nNote the Cyclone V has an embedded ARM core, whereas the Artix-7 does not.  If you want a Xilinx FPGA that has one of these HPS (Hard Processing System, aka baked-in CPU), take a look at the Zybo-7 which uses a Zynq FPGA.\nTinyFPGA-BX\nIf you want to go for a really cheap device, check out the TinyFPGA-BX.  I grabbed one for $38 and it was a great purchase.  It's based on a Lattice FPGA, and as I mentioned above, lets you use an open-source toolset.\nI was able to write the HelloWorld of electronics, a blinking LED, and deploy it to my TinyFPGA-BX board in about 20 minutes.  Keep in mind you probably will want to solder on pin headers to use the board on a breadboard, so remember that is doesn't come with them pre-attached.\nWe'll use the TinyFPGA-BX board as the target board for the reset of this article.\nNow with all of that background on FPGAs and tools, let's go through a making a simple design with Verilator, simulating it, and then building it for the TinyFPGA-BX.\nThinking about Hardware Design in HDLs\nYou often hear people mention how hardware programming, more often called designing, with Verilog or VHDL is so different from normal programming.  To an extent this is true, in that it doesn't resemble a normal imperative style and certainly not an object oriented style.  On the other hand, software folks are used to doing similar types of development in different areas.\nIn my mind it's easier to think of hardware designs as data flow graphs.  In HDLs you are declaring modules that are hooked together to implement various functionality.  Each module is made up of connections of wires and/or as processes that trigger on some condition, typically a clock signal and maybe a reset signal.  You can think of processes as logic updates that trigger based on an event such as the clock.\nA clock signal is just a value that toggles between 1 and 0 at some constant rate.  So you might talk about having a 200 MHz clock signal meaning it toggles between high and low 200e6 times per second.\nWires that connect modules together can be thought of like wires in a circuit board and one wire corresponds to a single bit.  You can have a collection of wires, called a bus, to have larger values, e.g. a byte, flow in and out of modules.\nWhat that means is that you are laying out blocks which interconnect with each other, sort of like how you would set up a complicated shell command.  It's just that here you can have many inputs and many outputs, and can end up with much more hierarchical layouts.  That is, a module can be made up of a bunch of smaller modules and just stitches them together.\nAnother way software engineers can relate, is that designing a hardware module is a lot like doing stream programming; you don't have general access to the next or previous items, unless you save them off in a temporary variable, you just operate on your current inputs and produce your output.\nSo when we look at our inputs and outputs in our modules, you can look at them as streaming interfaces of bits (or booleans), some of which are grouped together to make larger values like bytes.\nTypes of Circuits\nCombinational Circuits\nFor modules that are not clock driven, called combinational circuits (or sometimes combinatorial circuits), you are just hooking inputs through various logic operations, and producing outputs.  Since our wires are just booleans, we can use all of the normal logic operations: and, or, xor and not.\nBut enough chatting, let's see some actual Verilog code.  Here is a module that take two inputs wires and produces an xor of them as one ouput and an and of them for the other output signal:\n\nThis module defines a half-adder which takes two bits and produces the output of adding those two bits together also allowing for overflow and carrying the bit out to the next adder block in line.\nJust as an aside:  Seeing this circuit in my digital circuits course in college years ago was a big aha moment for me.  It was when I first saw how you could go from simple logic operations that you could implement pretty easily with bare transistors and start building up more complicated useful blocks.\nIn this module there is no clock, and no memory used.  It's sort of like a pure function: The output only depends on the inputs in this case.  Things get more interesting when you store values, sometimes called storing state.\nSequential Circuits\nFor clock driven modules, called sequential circuits, it's a lot like having an update tick function.  You have whatever input parameters, some state/memory within your module, and on each tick you need to decide how to change your outputs.\nHere's a simple module that takes a clock signal and has an update block that will run every time the clock changes to a 1.  This change from 0 to 1 is also known as the positive edge of the clock signal as it changes from a low to high value.\n\nA module can contain multiple blocks, sequential or combinational.  The assign syntax in the first example is one way to lay out combinational connections, the other is with always @(*) blocks, which are basically the same thing.\nWhy have a clock?\nOne question that might come up is why do you even need a clock signal?  Why not just let things update as fast as they can?  The problem there is that real circuits take time for their values to settle.  This is based on how they get laid out on the actual chip and how long it takes for signals to propogate around.\nSo there is some time that the result can be bouncing between various values while the inputs stay constant.  You don't want those intermittent values to get used downstream as inputs to the next part of your design, so you need to some sort of way to decide when values are valid.  A clock signal is the way to do this.\nThis is also why you can only run a circuit up to some maximum clock frequency.  Your design might need X nanoseconds for the worst-case path, called the critical path, to settle to its correct value.  If you run your circuit faster than that, you may latch (save) the wrong value and your design won't operate as you expect.\nSimulating and Deploying Designs\nSo let's create a simple blinky LED example on the TinyFPGA-BX.  This example is basically the template from the TinyFPGA-BX User Guide.  The difference is that we'll simulate with Verilator first and make sure things look good before deploying to our board.\nYou can grab the repo with the code from Here.  We'll start with the 00_blinky example.\nIn that example, the apio.ini, install_apio.bat, install_apio.sh and pins.pcf are taken as is from the apio_template portion of the TinyFPGA-BX guide.  The top.v is our verilog module that will blink the on-board LED periodically.  Main.cpp is the test code that we will compile with Verilator to create a program that simulates our design on our PC before trying it on the board itself.\nThe testbench code in main.cpp uses a template class for handling some basics like ticking the clock signal, and writing out waveform values.  This is based off of this ZipCPU blog article and is located at support/TestBench.h.\nIf we look at the top.v module we can see the following:\n\nThe module defines an input clock signal, the LED output signal and an output for the USB Pull up resistor, which was taken as is from the TinyFPGA-BX blinky exmaple.  We have a counter that increases by one every clock cycle and we see that on the last line of the module the LED should be on whenever the counter's 20th bit is a 1 and be off whenever the bit is a 0.  Go into your terminal and run make to build blinky and then run it.  It's compiled into a normal executable with Verilator, so you don't need the FPGA hooked up or anything at this point.\nIt might take a few seconds for it to run, and afterwards you should see a trace.vcd file get created.  Let's view the waveform in GtkWave.  Open up GtkWave and choose File -&gt; Open New Tab, navigate to the trace.vcd file and open it.  You'll see the following if you expand the TOP item in the tool window on the left side:\n \nYou can then select the CLK, LED, and num_counter signals, right click and choose Recurse Import -&gt; Append to add the waves to the main portion of the window.\n \nWhat you'll see is the following:\n \nHmm, looks like our LED isn't blinking.  What's going on?  The problem is we're zoomed in way too close.  We designed the blinking to be based on a 16Mhz input clock, and the LED turns on with the 20th bit, which means it takes 1048576 clock ticks for the LED to change.\nWe therefore expect in real life the LED to change states (1/16Mhz)*1,048,576 = ~0.065 seconds, so just a bit more than 10 times a second.\nIf we zoom out our simulation we see:\n \nNote that in our simulation we haven't set the tracing timescale to correspond to our real world clock, so you can't trust the time values in this case.\nDeploying to the TinyFPGA-BX board\nWe can now test our design on the real hardware using the apio program that the TinyFPGA-BX user guide discusses installing and using.  Rather than using the Atom editor we'll directly use the terminal instead.\nWhen you plug the board into your computer it will initially be in a waiting state, expecting you to upload a bitstream with the user LED fading in and out:\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\n\nWith the board connected to your system with a USB cable, you can run apio build and then apio upload.  As I'm using windows, even though I run the simulator from a bash prompt, I run the apio commands in cmd.exe.  I haven't taken the time to see if I could get the USB connection working through the WSL layer.\nRunning apio upload should result in output similar to the following:\n \nand you should see a rapidly blinking LED like in the video below:\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\nPerforming a sequence of steps in Hardware\nSo the question arises, how do you actually carry out an algorithm in hardware?  The answer is a state machine.  You have a series of steps, each one being a state, and you move from one state to the next evaluating the state per clock tick.\nYou can imagine your algorithm as a series of steps, down to the level of instructions if you wanted, where the current state index acts as the program counter.\nWith state machine you can create looping behavior or conditional behavior as well.  By changing what your next state is, you can create loops, or branches within your state machine's execution.\nSo let's go through a quick example of state machines as implemented in Verilog.  We'll create a simple state machine with three states where after a numner of clock ticks we'll proceed to the next state, where in the third state we move back to the initial one.\nIn the initial state we'll keep the LED off, move to blinking the LED in the second state, which I've called A and finally we'll hold the LED on in the third or B state.\nYou can follow along in the 01_state_machine example in the repo.  You can also just check out the entire verilog code on GitHub Here.\nFirst lets declare some constants for our states and a numbr of ticks per state.\n\nIn Verilog, you can use the localparam keyword to define a constant for your module.  There also exists a parameter keyword, but that is for adding parameterization to modules when they are instantiated, such as creating a 32 bit adder instead of an 8 bit adder.\nYou may also notice that we're using a constant named NUM_CYCLES_PER_UPDATE.  In this example, we'll look at how we can use the preprocessor to define different values for constants based on whether we are simulating the circuit or for when we're running on the actual board.\nThe preprocessor in verilog starts with a backtick, and similar to C there are the idef, ifndef, else, and endif directives.\n\nIn this case, we'll define the SIMULATION variable for the preprocessor in our Makefile when we call Verilator, and when we use apio to run the example on the TinyFPGA BX board, we won't have this defined and we'll synthesize the design with the values in the else branch.\nWith our constants defined, we can now get to the meat of this example, which is broken up into two processes.  The first process is where we update our counter and handle state transitions.\n\nYou'll notice we were able to comma separate the first two states in the case statement in order to run the same block in those cases.  You can't do the same thing with the default label though, so we just let the B_STATE fall through to the default case there.\nIn the second process we look at the current state and assign the LED the value for that state, using a bit in our counter for the blinking case.\n\nOnce we run make and then the resulting state_machine_01 executable, we can view the trace.vcd waveform and should see the following once the relevant signals are added and we zoom out a bit:\n \nWe see our circuit runs as expected moving between states and eventually resetting back to the initial state.  We also see that the LED behavior changes as we move from one state to the other.  If we zoom in a bit, we can see the clock cycles more clearly and the LED toggling on and off in the A state.\n \nDeploying to the TinyFPGA-BX board\nSimilarly to the LED example, we can run apio build and apio upload to synthesize and load our design onto our TinyFPGA-BX board.\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\nConclusion\nWe've now seen how we can build up simple designs for an inexpensive FPGA board, using Verilator to simulate our modules using C++ beforehand.  There is a lot more that we can dive into with FPGAs and in a future article I plan to show how to drive some seven segment displays as well as build up a VGA timing circuit.\nI hope you've enjoyed this introduction.

I've also switched from tags to branches so that things like the new Docker build system from this article can be added more easily.  The branches follow the format post_N so this post's branch is post_2.\nGiven the Docker build system is much easier to use, I recommend doing that instead of all the details spelled out here, which are abstracted away if you do that.\nBack to the Original Article\nIn the last article I recommended some free books you can find online for learning electronics.

With that, we can now more easily integrate some other great tools, like Conan, to build up a nicer simulation environment.\nIt turns out we can do everything from within a WSL environment of Ubuntu, including running OpenGL applications at native speeds.  The rest of this article will assume you're building under Windows using WSL, although most of the steps are obviously the same for a proper Linux installation.\nI've also built everything for Windows natively using Visual Studio 2019 Community, but there are some extra steps to build our tools with that, so we'll take the easier path for now.  Let me know in the comments if you'd like me to cover building everything for Windows natively!\nWhy not apio?\nIn the first article we used apio to synthesize our project and a Makefile to build the simulation.  With moving to CMake for the simulation, it got me thinking about how to integrate our synthesis step into CMake as well.\nI ended up finding out that apio still uses arachne-pnr for the place and route step, but it is now recommended to use nextpnr instead.  That was enough motivation for me to build up a CMake script to do all of the same steps that apio was doing for us, which is just synthesis, place-and-route, and bitstream generation.\nInstalling the Tools\nWe need to install four main tools:\n\nVerilator: Handles compiling our code for simulation as before\nYosys: The synthesis tool that will build our design\nNextPNR: Place-and-route tool that will figure out how to fit things into our FPGA\nIcePack: Tool that packs the netlist from NextPNR into a bitstream we can load on to the TinyFPGA-BX\n\nas well as\n\nCMake: Tool to generate a build file from our project file, e.g. a Makefile\nConan: A tool to download or build and install C++ libraries that we want to use as dependencies in our simulation projects.\n\nFinally, in order to flash our design to the board, we'll also install\n\nTinyprog: Flash tool for the TinyFPGA-BX board to load our bitstream.\n\nVerilator\nWe'll build verilator ourselves to make sure we get a recent version.  Nothing difficult here, just clone the verilator repo and checkout the stable branch, anything after 4.022 is good since that's when CMake project support was added.  You can find more details on the Verilator website but the basic steps are:\nInstall the prerequisites:\n\nThen clone the repo and build\n\nIcestorm and other Hardware Tools\nNext we need to build and install the tools for synthesizing the design for our FPGA.  The steps to follow are taken from the Icestorm website:\nFirst install the prerequisites:\n\nBuild and install Icestorm tools like icepack\n\nBuild and install nextPNR\n\nFinally, build and install Yosys\n\nSoftware Tools\nNow we will install Conan and CMake.  To install Conan, we can follow the instruction on the Conan website.\n\nWe can grab CMake from apt.  The version with Ubuntu 18.04 is fine (3.10.2); anything after version 3.10 will work for us:\n\nTinyProg\nTinyprog can be installed with pip:\n\nTesting out our Toolchain\nI updated both the 00_blinky and 01_state_machine projects to use the new CMake and Conan based project setup.  We can start with blinky as a sanity check that our toolchain is setup properly.\nThe conanfile.txt defines any dependent libraries we want to pull in and is the input for Conan.  In this case we pull in the awesome spdlog library for logging:\n\nWe also indicate that conan should generate CMake output files that we will use in our CMakeLists.txt file.\nLet's start the build by creating a build directory under the 00_blinky directory and having conan install the dependencies for us:\n\nMost of the gritty CMake details are wrapped up in a macro and a function declared in scripts in the cmake/ folder of the repository.  Have a look at the updated 00_blinky example's CMake file:\n\nHere we use the fpga_project macro defined in the fpga_project.cmake script and provide the simulation source files and the top level verilog file.  The macro does some initialization, pulling in the conan dependencies and setting up both a target for our simulation and a target for synthesizing the design.\nHere we've also set the option for SYNTH_BY_DEFAULT which means that running cmake --build . will also run the synthesis target for us, creating a bitstream we can flash to the FPGA.\nIf you don't include that option, you can synthesize the project by building the synthesis target project manually.  By default, the name used is &lt;target name&gt;_synth, so for blinky the synthesis target is blinky_synth which you could build with cmake --build . --target blinky_synth assuming you are in the build directory.\nWhile still in the build directory, run cmake and try a build\n\nHopefully everything works and you end up with a bin/ folder with a blinky binary for the simulation and a top.bin file in the build directory which is the generated bitstream.\nFlashing the build from WSL\nTo finish the entire workflow, we'll flash the top.bin we generated above through WSL using tinyprog.\nWSL supports serial ports by way of /dev/ttyS0 where the 0 is replaced with the Windows COM port number you see when you attached the FPGA board to your system and look in Device Manager\n \nSeeing that our board is on COM3 in this case, we know to use /dev/ttyS3.  So we can load and boot the bitstream with:\n\nYou should see it load the design onto the board outputting something like below and see the blinking LED just like before.\n\nAdding SFML as a dependency using conan as a package manager\nSoon we'll want to display some graphics in our simulations, mocking out the devices we want to eventually hook up to our FPGA designs.  This isn't strictly necessary for this example, but later when we do a VGA controller, this will be really useful.\nFor this, we'll ues SFML, which provides a nice C++ API for graphics, as well as other things like audio and networking.\nConan doesn't have SFML in the default repository, so first we need to add the Bincrafters repository to conan:\n\nNow we can add SFML as a dependency to a project.  Look at the conanfile.txt in 01_state_machine and you'll see:\n\nThis specifies our two dependencies for this project: SFML and spdlog, and that we want cmake files as the output, just like in the previous example.\nWe also include the specific options for sfml, which is that we want to use the graphics portion from it and use shared libraries.\nFinally the imports at the end are a standard block from the conan website on making sure the dlls (on Windows), and the dylibs (On Mac) are copied to our output bin directory so we can run them properly when building on those OSes.\nBrief Aside on Linux RUNPATHs\nFor those interested, on Linux the linked libraries are found through the RUNPATH, so the built simulation binary will have paths baked in for our conan repo .sos.\nFor example if you run\n\nyou can find the RUNPATHs baked into the binary.  For the upcoming project we'll build shortly, you'll see something like:\n\nState Machine CMake File\nFor the Updated blinking LED state machine example, we change things up a bit and don't use the fpga_project macro directly.  We will have two simulation projects in this case.  One is the original one like from last article, and the second is an SFML window that maps the LED state to the background.\nThe CMake file looks like:\n\nWe manually call the fpga_project_setup macro to pull in our conan dependencies, and then have the two fpga_simulation_project macro calls.  Finally we use the ice40_synthesis function to specify the synthesis target, having it synthesize by default.\nInitial SFML Build errors\nOne issue I ran into was that when using SFML with Conan and building an example that loaded textures, I was getting linker errors, where the linker said it could not find some SFML functions.\n\nI looked at the verbose output of CMake, and saw that it was trying to link against the SFML graphics lib and that a function called loadFromFile with the exact arguments, std::string const&amp; and sf::Rect const&amp;, existed.\nSince I could see the function existed, but it just couldn't link, I realized it must be an ABI (Application Binary Interface) issue, where the versions of std::string I was trying to link didn't match between conan's SFML library it had built and the binary I was building.\nIt turns out that conan defaults to using the pre-C++11 ABI for compatibility, although I can't honestly say why that would be the default nowadays.  In any case, the fix is pretty easy: set your default profile to build with the newer ABI and use C++17 by default, which is what we're using in our projects.\n\nIf you do a conan install and are still seeing the issue, try building SFML during an install to make sure the ABI settings are picked up\n\nX Server problems\nWith all of the build issues out of the way, you'd think we're done, but not quite.  In order to display a graphical application from WSL on windows we need an X Server, and one that can handle OpenGL graphics.\nI have used VcXSrv in the past as an XWindows server to run graphical applications, like the Erlang debugger, and it worked great.  I never tried running OpenGL applications however.  VcXSrv has an option when you start it to use 'Native OpenGL' and it mentions exporting LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1 in order for things to work.\nWhen I tried running a simulation that used graphics, I noticed the framerate was abysmal compared to when I had built it with Visual Studio previously.  I was only seeing about 1 fps, if that.  Simulations running on the command line ran really fast, so something weird was going on.\nI tried running glxgears to see if it was somehow related to the verilator simulation, which would have been weird since other non-graphics simulations ran very quickly.  I saw that glxgears would only display the first frame and never animate.  A couple of searches later, and I stumbled upon this SuperUser question that pointed me in the right direction.\nI had to disable Native OpenGL in VcXSrv and make sure that LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT was not exported, or exported as 0.  With that, glxgears ran at ~1200fps and running DISPLAY=:0 state_machine_sfml ran at full framerate with no issues.\nIf you followed all of that, then everything should be ready to build our workflow under WSL.  Or you could just use a proper linux desktop from the get go and skip some of the heart-ache.\nBuilding a simulation of a blinking LED with SFML\nWe've now done quite a bit: changing up our build system, adding in both CMake and conan to the process.  Let's look at the state machine SFML example now.  Have a look at 01_state_machine/main_sfml.cpp.\nThe code for the simulation is a bare bones SFML application with a loop that checks for the window still being open.  We run a certain number of simulation ticks per frame, which we can control with a constant defined at the top of the file.\nThe actual rendering in this case is very simple:\n\nWe set a background clear color with more green when the core's LED signal is high.\nIf we now build the example, starting from the 01_state_machine example folder:\n\nYou should see the following window pop up:\n \nConclusion\nNext time we'll get back to some more Verilog and create a seven segment display driver. We'll start with a parallel output version, move to a shift register version, and then do some time-multiplexing to enable multiple seven segment displays.\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/015-fpga-start2/","title":"FPGA Design for Software Engineers, Part 2 - Simulation and Build Tools"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/016-fpga-start3/":{"body":"Last time we took a break from Verilog and hardware design to improve our build system.  This time we're back to Verilog and for our next FPGA project we'll create a seven segment driver circuit that will allow us to output hex characters to a single display.\nA seven segment display is a set of LEDs arranged like an eight plus a decimal point like you see on cheap alarm clocks and the like.\n \nArticle Series\n\nVerilog and State Machines\nSimulation and Build Tools\nSeven Segment Displays\nDocker Builds\nBuild System Updates, ECP5 Support\nTime-Multiplexed Seven Segment Displays\n\nUpdates Feb 23, 2021\nAs mentioned at the end of this article, I've moved the main repository over to GitHub, so the article has been updated with links to that repo.\nOur first pass\nFirst we'll build up a decoder module that takes a hexadecimal digit and outputs a byte to turn on the correct segments.  In the first example, we'll simply put all 8 LED values onto FPGA output pins.  Later we'll look at decreasing the number of physical pins we need using shift registers.\nThere are many tutorials online discussing the basics on seven segment displays which are very good.  For instance, the tutorial on Jameco, where I tend to grab many electronics components from, is quite good.\nOne thing to keep in mind when laying out your circuit is whether you have common anode or common cathode seven segment displays.  You have common anode if you hook the shared pin of the display to Vcc and common cathode if you hook it to GND.  In my case I have common cathode segments, so all of the schematics are assuming you're using the same.\nBuilding a seven segment display encoder in Verilog\nThe main idea is that we take in 4 bits as a single hex digit and output the 8 values for each of the segments, and the decimal point, that we want to light up on the seven segment display.  If we assign a bit to each of the segments and decimal point, we can then come up with our mapping.  First lets look at the pinout of the seven segment displays I'm using:\n \nThe CC pin here on the top and bottom are the common cathode, and will be hooked to ground.\nYou can choose whatever mapping you want, but in my case, I chose to have the decimal point in the most significant bit (MSB) and starting with a on the top left, going around clockwise for the lower bits.  The one weird thing is that this swaps the f and g segments, at least as named, in the mapping but it made more sense to me to follow a clock-wise pattern in this case.\nGiven the pinout above, we'll start with bit 0 as a at the top to the right of the common pin and move clockwise around the device, but skipping the decimal point until the end.  That gives us a mapping where we assign for the eight output bits as dp f g e d c b a\nFor example, with the above image we have the letter a lit up.  To achieve that we light up all of the segments except d at the bottom and the decimal point.  That gives us a binary value of: 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 which converted to hex is 0x77.\nIn Verilog, our module just needs a case statement to setup the mapping as a combinational circuit:\n\nYou can follow along with the code in the repository branch for this article.\nThe module itself lives in hex_to_7seg.v in the lib/ folder, which is where I'm placing any modules that we'll reuse across projects.  Our CMake script we discussed last time also assumes this is where extra modules live.\nWe use a * for the sensitivity list, so that any time i_val changes the outputs should be updated.  That is, this is like the half-adder we made in the first article and is combinational, i.e. doesn't have any state of its own; the output only depends on the current input.\nThe case statement maps all of the values on the 4-bit input to the segments as we outlined above.  We use the hexadecimal constant notation on the case labels and the segment values, 'h&lt;X&gt;, although we could have just as easily used decimal or the binary 'b&lt;WXYZ&gt; binary notation.\nConnecting our Counter to the Display\nFor this first test of the seven segment decoder, we'll output all of the segment values as individual pins, using 8 output pins PIN1-PIN8 to drive our display.  You can find the code in the 02_seven_seg_parallel/ folder.\nWe create the top module (in top.v) to have the following port list:\n\nWe use a counter like in the previous examples, using a few bits as the input to our decoder.  We define some constants for which bit is the low bit and which is the high bit, which we change depending on if we build for simulation or for synthesis on the real board, similar to how we did in the state_machine example.\nWe also declare an instance of our decoder module, hooking the counter in as the input and tying the output to a set of wires declared in our top module.\n\nHere we are instantiating the hex_to_7seg module that we defined above, giving it a name (which we don't care about here) of segDisplay.  We provide the input and output connections to the module using named arguments: the .i_val(XYZ) syntax.  Notice i_val and o_seg_vals are the parameter names of the ports in the hex_to_7seg module definition above.\nWe could also use positional arguments, but since Verilog supports named parameters, we might as well use them to keep things easier to maintain in the future.  By using named parameters, even if we rearrange the order of the arguments in the module definition, we'll match things up properly.\nThe last major piece in the top module is to take the output from our decoder and assign it to our output pins:\n\nSince we are not outputting a value that ever turns the decimal point on from our decoder, we don't use the MSB value from the seg_out wires and instead assign it to an unused wire to avoid a warning.\nWe instead assign the value of the counter's LED blinking bit to our decimal point so that it will blink on and off as we count up.\nAdding a mock seven segment display to our test bench\nNow on the simulation side, we need to have a class that takes in the output from our circuit and lights up mock LED segments so we can see if everything works as we expect.  We could of course just create a waveform to check things like with the state_machine but since we have a fancy SFML setup already, let's make a graphical example.\nIf you look in the repo's assets/ folder, you'll see some amazing programmer art of horizontal, vertical and decimal point LED segments for both on and off states.  We'll load these textures and use them in 8 individual SFML sprites that we'll manually place into a decent location to mimic a real seven segment display.\nYou can see the mock seven segment display code in the support/SevenSegDisplay.h header and its corresponding support/SevenSegDisplay.cpp source file.\nThe code here is pretty simple, we provide a reference to a struct of textures to use for the various segment states and the segment display class provides an interface for setting the state of each segment and drawing it to the screen.\nIn the main simulation file we load up our textures and create our mock seven segment display with the following code:\n\nthen in our simulation loop, after running the circuit however many number of ticks per frame we want, we clear the screen, update each segment's current state from our output pins, and then draw the result to the screen.\n\nRunning the simulation\nYou can build the simulation and synthesize the project using our CMake/Conan workflow that we developed last time:\n\nIf you run the simulation (in WSL):\n\nYou should see the following window pop up with our segment display counting up in hexadecimal:\n \nLaying it out on a breadboard\nSo far we've been strictly in the realm of simulation or using the built in LED.  Now we're going to build our circuit out using a breadboard and wires to hook everything together.\nTo start with we'll look at the schematic view to see how things are hooked together.  This was drawn up in KiCad:\n \nWe will power the TinyFPGA board itself through USB, and we can use the GND pins on the TinyFPGA board to complete the circuit for the LEDs.  The output pins need to go through current-limiting resistors when paired with the LEDS in the seven segment display, or else when we pull a pin high it will be short-circuit and we could burn up our chip.\nA minor note, but in the schematic I'm using a pin compatible part with package KCSC02, which is not the same physical package as the components I'm using on my breadboard which are in package 5611AS.  The KCSC one, which I was able to find in the KiCad library, is a surface mount package versus the through-hole ones we'll use on the breadboard.\nWhen we lay it out in real life, it will look something like the following.  Here I'm using the program Fritzing to diagram out how the breadboard looks and we'll break it down as the layouts get more complicated in the future.\n \nIf we look at the Ice40 datasheet, and look at the I/O DC electrical characteristics table in section 4.14 on page 25, we see that the max current for a normal pin is 8 milliamps for the 3.3V the board uses.  We're not configuring the pins as high current LED outputs in this case, so we'll use the lowest number in that table.\nGiven Ohm's Law, we can choose the value of the resistor so that we get a current of ~8ma.  R = V / I = 3.3V / 0.008 A = 412.5 Ohms, so a standard 430 or 470 Ohm resistor will be close enough for our purposes.  In my case, I went with 470 Ohm ones.\nIf we deploy the design to our circuit above, we'll see our implementation running in meat space\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\nDriving a seven segment display with fewer pins\nEverything works fine so far, but we're rather limited because we are using 8 of our 40ish pins on our TinyFPGA-BX board to drive only a single seven segment display.  It would be nicer if we didn't need to use so many pins because they're a pretty restricted resource for us.\nWhat we can do, since the segment displays will update at a much slower pace than our circuit design runs, is use a shift register to use only three pins of the FPGA to get the eight values needed out, and use the shift register chip to drive the actual seven segment display.\nJust like with seven segment displays themselves, there are also many tutorials out there describing shift registers in detail, so I won't repeat all of details here.  The short story is that you can pipe in bits serially, one at a time, and then 'latch' (i.e. store and use) the last 8 values you sent in and have them show up as a parallel set of signals from the shift register.\nOne tutorial I found from a quick search is this one on lastminuteengineers.com and looks pretty good.\nCreating a shift register in Verilog\nOn the FPGA side, we'll be doing the opposite: taking a parallel signal, the byte for the seven segment display, and outputting a serial signal.  That is to say, at one clock we'll save off all of the bits of the input byte, and then over the course of a number of clock cycles after that, sent it out one bit at a time.\nOn the outside, on our breadboard, we'll hook that up to a 74HC595 serial in, parallel out shift register.  To output into a 74HC595, we just need to have the byte we want to send out coming into our module as input, and then have the 3 pins needed to shift it out.  That is, we'll have the output data value pin, a clock pin for the data signal, and a signal to indicate we're done shifting data and that the 74HC595 shift register on the breadboard should latch the current value onto its eight output pins.\nIn terms of implementation of our shift register module, we also need to have an input to trigger us to start shifting out the current byte.  We then move through a state machine that shifts out each bit of our byte and finally triggers the latch signal before moving back to a waiting state.\n\n\n\n    \n        stateDiagram\n    [*] --&gt; WAIT_STATE\n    WAIT_STATE --&gt; SHIFT_STATE\n    SHIFT_STATE --&gt; SHIFT_TICK\n    SHIFT_TICK --&gt; SHIFT_STATE\n    SHIFT_TICK --&gt; STORE_STATE\n    STORE_STATE --&gt; WAIT_STATE\n    \n\nThe code for the shift register is in /lib/shift_reg_output.v:\n\nNow in our new top module in 03_seven_seg_shift_reg/top.v, we don't need to use 8 output pins\nsince we'll shift out our display value one bit at a time.  Instead our port map will now look like this:\n\nOur decoder will be the same as before, outputting a byte that we want to display on the seven segment display using the counter bits as input.  We'll now instead connect the output wires of the decoder seg_out to our shift register and toggle the shift out based on the LSB (Least Significant Bit) of our counter value so that whenever it changes, we'll shift out our new value.\n\nand at the bottom of the top module, we assign our wires from the output of the shift register instance to our output pins:\n\nCreating a mock shift register reader\nOn the simulation side, we'll want to be able to read the shift register values as they are pushed out and latch the value to our seven segment display once the latch signal is raised.  So we do the opposite and read in a serial stream of bits and present the current latched value as the output.\nWe will soon want to be able to have more than just 8 bits on our output in order to represent having multiple shift registers chained together, so the simulation SIPO (serial in parallel out) shift register in /lib/SerInParOutShiftRegister.h is a template class that lets us choose the number of shift registers we want and uses a std::bitset underneath for storage:\n\nIf you build and run the 03_seven_seg_shift_reg example simulation, you'll see a single seven segment display counting up just like in our previous case, but now we're only using three pins for our display!\nBuilding the circuit\nWe now need to add the 74HC595 chip to our circuit and wire things up, now just using pins 1, 2, 3 from the FPGA.  The following schematic shows how it sits between the FPGA PINs and the set of resistors feeding to the seven segment display.\n \nNotice that we have two extra pins to concern ourselves with here: the output enable and the shift register's reset pin.  The reset pin should be tied high, i.e. a wire connecting it to Vcc, and the output enable should be tied low, i.e. a wire connecting it directly to ground.  This way our circuit will be able to output values and will not be constantly held in reset.\nTo lay this out on a breadboard, we'll want to lay it out something like this:\n \n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\nIssues I ran into\nI think it's helpful to see where things go wrong, so I thought I'd share some of the issues I ran into when going from the sunny day simulation environment to trying to make the design run on the bread board.\nTiming Constraints\nInitially I designed everything and was happy with the simulation, but when I hooked up the circuit as shown, it wasn't working.  The LED segments weren't doing anything at all.\nI first checked that all the connections looked good, made sure if I manually connected the wires to Vcc instead of the shift register that they'd light up, and everything looked good.  It occurred to me that maybe I was running things too fast, as I initially had simply hooked the shift register's clock input to the main 16Mhz clock.\nLooking through the datasheet, under 7.6 Timing Requirements, you see that at 2V you can run at a max of 5Mhz and at 4.5V you can run at 25 Mhz.  We're powering the shift register off of the TinyFPGA-BX at 3.3V so it'll be somewhere in between and sure enough, once I lowered the clock by creating a register that toggled based on higher bit of the counter, the LEDs started lighting up.\nUsing the Counter Value Directly for the Divided Clock\nI had tried just passing in the counter[CLOCK_BIT] into the shift register's clock input, but I got a warning from Verilator about the signal being unoptimizable.  Some quick searching said it looks like it creates a feedback loop, so I changed to have a reg that I update in the clock process, buffering the signal, and that got rid of the warning.\nSerialization Endianness\nOnce the segments were lighting up, I noticed the patterns were wrong.  The patterns were consistent in how they appeared, but not what I expected.  It turns out that the shift register expects the bits to come into the MSB first down to the LSB.  I was initially sending them in LSB to MSB, causing me to have a reversed pattern on the output from what I was expecting.\nChanging which bit was shifted out in the shift_reg_output module and making the corresponding changes on the simulated shift register side and everything showed up correctly.\nConclusion\nWe covered quite a bit this time and now are building circuits out with real components on breadboards, which I find to be really satisfying to hook up and see working in real life.\nNext time we'll go into how we can drive multiple seven segment displays, still using the same three output pins of the FPGA.\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/016-fpga-start3/","title":"FPGA Design for Software Engineers, Part 3 - Seven Segment Displays"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/017-kubuntu/":{"body":"About a week ago, I decided to give another go at using Linux as my primary OS.  This came about after my brother mentioned he had recently done the same and was really enjoying it.\nI've used Linux as my main OS a few times before, along with MacOS a few times as well, but I always ended up back to using Windows.  Recently with WSL I had less cause to need Linux directly, but a couple of things spurred me on to reconsider.\nI used to do a lot of work in Visual Studio, but have since switched to Visual Studio Code as my main development environment.  This was originally one of my main reasons for staying on Windows, but since my coding interests have changed over the last few years, I don't even have Visual Studio installed any more.  Their badgering you for an online account to use the community edition being a major motivation to stop using that product, by the way.\nI've been using WSL2 as my main shell, which although faster, uses a lot more memory and requires keeping my repos under the WSL filesystem for it to be fast, which is sort of inconvenient.\nBesides coding, most other programs I use are either browser based services, or OSS like VLC, KiCAD, etc, so switching to Linux doesn't mean having to give those up.\nIt also used to be that battery management on Linux would cut my system usage by a few hours, but so far on this more recent laptop, an HP Envy, it seems my battery utilization has gotten better on Kubuntu.\nFinally, I used to play video games on my computer mostly, but I now prefer to play on my Switch, or one of my older consoles I've acquired such as a SNES or NES.  Steam on Linux has also improved the last few years so a number of titles that I have yet to play look like they should work in any case.\n \nAnnoyances with Windows 10\nWindows 10 has been overall a good system, but there are a few annoyances that have built up over the years that finally gave me pause.  In particular the random upgrades that I couldn't skip indefinitelty.  It's my computer, I'm an expert user and I don't need my OS determining when I'm ready to upgrade.  It's sort of a slap in the face and a reversal of the roles of computer and user.\nI understand that many people get viruses and that was a primary concern when the auto-upgrade feature was added to Windows 10.  I personally haven't had a virus on my system in over 20 years.  I also don't open random email links, go to sketchy websites or download warez, so my risk profile is pretty darn low.  In any case, I keep lots of backups and much of my work is in git repos anyways so that even if I got a virus it wouldn't be the end of the world.  At the end of the day, my computer is a tool that I use, and I want to be the one who determines my workflow.\nI also hate that when an upgrade would occur, half the time I would be asked about some new features I had to disable or else be tracked with.  On top of that, I was also not a fan of Edge being set as my default browser randomly.  No upgrade should overwrite your custom settings, otherwise they're doing it wrong.\nA huge annoyance with Windows 10, has been my systems randomly waking up to do some check and then not going back to sleep properly and draining the battery.  This has happened on multiple systems, laptops and desktops, and no amount of searching around delivered a work around, so I had given up and just accepted an extremely annoying OS behavior.\nNone of these were deal breakers initially, but over time it was a realization that my computer wasn't working how I, the user, wanted it to and knowing that I had other options.\nOS choice\nI ended up installing Kubuntu 20.10 on my laptop, and didn't require many tweaks to get it to a perfect state for development.  The UI looks great out of the box, is easy to tweak and almost eveyy package I need is available through apt.\nUX tweaks\nOn any desktop system, there are a few UX improvements I always use and it turns out that Kubuntu had them available without much work.\nI always map Caps Lock to Ctrl which in Windows requires a registry edit, but in Kubuntu is nicely exposed through a settings UI option.\nI also make heavy use of a clipboard app for copied item history.  Kubuntu has one installed out of the box and setting the global hotkey to what I'm used to got me up and running instantly.\nVirtaul desktops are a feature I hadn't used in a long time, not having found a decent version on Windows, but on KDE I'm really liking having my various use case contexts separated into different desktops.\nCloud access\nA large improvement to my workflow has been changing how I access files in the cloud.\nI had been using Google Drive as cloud storage for a few documents, but it turned out there isn't a good client available on Linux.  I could get access through the Dolphin file manager, but editing files would require a download to temp file, edit, and then asking to upload again cycle that was annoying.\nInstead I found that Fastmail (my main email provider), exposes their Files section over Webdav.  So using davfs2 I now have seamless access to my cloud files as another mounted filesystem and can interact with the files without any odd workflow.\nThat led me to realize I could setup sshfs as well to have seamless access to my local raspberry pi NAS files.  This is actually a huge improvement for how I accessed these files compated to Windows where I always used Filezilla,\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, using Kubuntu 20.10, I have a perfect development environment that is faster and uses less memory for my use cases as I don't need WSL2 and its VM running.  I also no longer have to deal with various Windows 10 annoyances and haven't hit any real problems with Linux so far.  Finally numerous aspects such as battery life and remote files access have actually improved substantially for me.\nSince the experiment has been so successful I'm very much considering dual booting my desktop system and using Kubuntu as my daily driver with Windows 10 just for the odd occasion that I want to play a Windows exclusive game.\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/017-kubuntu/","title":"Switching to Kubuntu 20.10 as primary OS"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/018-fpga-docker-build/":{"body":"As I mentioned in the last blog post I recently switched my laptop over to using Linux as my main OS from Windows 10.  As part of that I was going through setting up all of my build tools for various projects and I realized the FPGA build system was a bit more cumbersome than it needed to be and, utilizing docker, it could be made more developer friendly.\nArticle Series\n\nVerilog and State Machines\nSimulation and Build Tools\nSeven Segment Displays\nDocker Builds\nBuild System Updates, ECP5 Support\nTime-Multiplexed Seven Segment Displays\n\nDocker Build Setup\nI only recently discovered how great docker can be for development, being something like 5 years behind others on the matter.  So I created a docker file for setting up a build container along with a helper script.  Since getting volume mapping and such just right can be difficult, the helper script is there to perform the setup as well as for building the individual projects.\nThe scripts are setup so that your user ID and group ID are used for build artifacts.  When building, a build/ folder with the resulting artifacts is created within the container, but since the uid/gid match the host user's, you'll be able to access the files as you'd expect outisde of the container.\nA neat feature of the setup is that the container's built conan libraries are mapped under the build/conan_data folder on the host, so that consecutive builds don't cause them to be rebuilt all the time.\nSetup Container\nThe first step to get going is to set up the docker container using the following command:\n\nThe docker_build.sh isn't very complicated, so feel free to peek inside to see how the user id and group id are being mapped.\nBuilding a project\n\nFor example:\n\nThe artifacts in this example will show up under build/01_state_machine  Both the simulation project and the bitstream file will be built.\nMoving over to GitHub\nI've recently started moving my main repositories over from GitLab to GitHub.  I still really like GitLab, but the way that commits are counted in the UTC timezone was pretty annoying, and since GitHub has provided private repos for a while I decided to make the move over.\nI've also swapped to using master as the current state of the repo, including projects I have not yet written about.  Each article will still include a git branch you can use to check the best current state of the code for that article however.\nYou can find the fpga_start repo here: https://github.com/srjilarious/fpga_start\nNext Time\nI recently got some time to finally build out the real hardware version of a time-multiplexed seven segment display circuit (05_seven_seg_shift_reg_multi_time if you want a sneak peek), and I planto write up the article on that -- soonish.\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/018-fpga-docker-build/","title":"FPGA Design for Software Engineers - Docker Builds"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/019-fpga-build-updates/":{"body":"It's been a while since the last article and I've recently come back to playing with my FPGA repo.  Given the amount of time that has passed there were some updates needed for the Dockerfile and a couple of improvements I wanted to make.\nArticle Series\n\nVerilog and State Machines\nSimulation and Build Tools\nSeven Segment Displays\nDocker Builds\nBuild System Updates, ECP5 Support\nTime-Multiplexed Seven Segment Displays\n\nBuild System Updates\nI updated the Dockerfile to use Ubuntu 22.04 as the base image, and cleaned up the package installation so that it does apt install just once rather than having it scattered around.  Also thanks to @asahsieh for the PR that fixed being able to git clone from veripool without disabling SSL.\nWhile doing this I removed a bunch of half-finished projects or ones that I haven't yet written up blog posts about yet.\nConanfile.txt No More\nI recently started using conan.cmake in other CMake based projects for using conan.  It removes the extra step of doing conan install .. and instead puts everything into your CMake files, which is nice.  I had been using the conan_cmake_run macro, but it seems that it's now deprecated, moving towards a bit more verbose setup, but one that should be more future proof for Conan 2.0.\nSo now in a demo/example, you'll see a block like the following to setup the extra simulation packages:\n\nThe generator has changed to cmake_find_package, which means you now can use the standard find_package system from CMake for your dependencies, rather than the ${CONAN_LIBS_XYZ} variables that were created before.\nAdding Lattice ECP5 Support\nI heard about the ECP5 line of FPGAs from Lattice while keeping an eye on the TinyFPGA EX board.  Unfortunately that project seems to be dead.  I found another board called the ULX3S which has a few options for the size of the ECP5 you want to get, and these can have up to 84,000 LUTs versus the Ice40 on the TinyFPGA-BX which has only 8,000.\nSince that gives the opportunity for doing much larger designs in the future, I wanted to add support for the ECP5 line to the build system since Yosys also has support for them.\nAfter adding in the new tools to the Docker file, some copy/pasting and messing with a new yosys_ecp5.cmake script, You can now target the ECP5 FPGAs as well as the Ice40 FPGAs.\nTo handle this, it made sense to move away from the fpga_project macro that did both the simulation and synthesis target setup and break it out more explicitly for each project.  This is because you will need a different top-level verilog for each FPGA you target, so rather than going crazy with parameters to the fpga_project macro, I just split it out into different target calls.\nYou can see the 00_blinky example for how this will look for supporting both ECP5 and Ice40 flows. Its CMakeLists.txt file now looke like:\n\nNotice that here I've shown creating separate simulation targets for the ECP5 and the Ice40 versions.  As I work through other examples, I will instead have the actual logic in a main verilog file and separate top level verilog files that just map the board pins into the design.\nWith ECP5, there is a different pin constraint file format used, called .lpf, and I've moved the Ice40 one and it into the support/ folder and renamed them to match the board they go with.\nUploading a Design to the ULX3S\nLooking at the manual from ULX3S, I ended up cloning the fujprog repo and building it from source.  It was really fast and worked out of the box without issues.  I also tried openFPGALoader but it failed to upload the bitstream right away and I haven't investigated it any further so far.\nBlinky Updates\nFor 00_blinky on the ULX3S, since there are 8 LEDs available, I map a larger part of the counter to the LEDs.  I also added a check for the second user button being down to pause the counter.\n \nState Machine Updates\n01_state_machine has been updated so that the state machine itself is contained in its own state_machine.v module.  The Ice40 and ECP5 top level modules then just do the mapping of their pins into that module.\nOne nice benefit of this setup is that the state_machine module can be parameterized for simulation by default, and then overriden in the board specfic top-level modules, removing the need for the `ifdef SIMULATION blocks from before.\nFor the ECP5 version, the state machine LED is mapped to all 8 of the user leds:\n \nTestBench.h changes\nIn order to make the simulations for different boards work properly, I had to have a way to cycle the clock pin for each board, but they are named differently depending on the board.\nSince that had always been a bit hacky anyways, I reworked the TestBench template class to expect to be subclassed to provide a setClock method.  This lets us refer to CLK on a TinyFPGA-BX and to i_clk on the ULX3S.\nI looked at different ways to handle this with template magic - thinking maybe passing a reference to the clock signals member from the verilated module would work.  The problem ended up being that the signals are implemented as references in the verilated module, and it turns out you can't have a pointer to a member that is a reference, so that approach ended up not working.\nSo now instead of creating a pointer to your testbench module like this:\n\nYou instead subclass the Testbench template like this:\n\nConclusion\nNow with the build system cleaned up and able to target different FPGAs and boards more easily, I'm looking forward to cleaning up and finally releasing the multiple seven segment display article I talked about two years ago.\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/019-fpga-build-updates/","title":"FPGA design for Software Engineers - Build System Updates, ECP5 Support"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/020-rust-unit-test-layout/":{"body":"I've been succeeding in my fourth attempt at learning to use Rust.  I come from mostly a C++ background, and I've struggled the first couple of times I've tried to pick up Rust, ultimately stopping the effort to work on the next shiny quarter.\nI started porting over my Nintendo 6502 processor emulator from C++ as a larger project to play around with.  One thing I had done in the C++ one is have tons of tests for the different instructions - checking clock cycles and internal register states for the emulated CPU.  Most of these tests ended up split up across different files to keep the codebase manageable.\nUnit Testing in Rust\nIn Rust, the guides all mention keeping your unit tests in the same file in a sub module declared in the file and marked as a test module with #[cfg(test)].\nYou can also have an integration tests folder that lives as a sibling folder to the src folder, but there the idea is to handle the modules as black boxes without the ability to peek into the internals - which in some cases can be useful in unit tests.\nSplitting your Rust Unit Tests into Multiple Files\nIt turns out to not be very difficult to split up your unit tests into separate files, but it took me a bit to figure out and thought it might useful to others.  Here is what the layout of my dummy project looks like now:\n\nAll I've done is move the tests module's code into the cpu_tests.rs file in the subfolder tests.\ncpu_tests.rs\n\nI then have a tests/mod.rs that includes all of the test files, tests/cpu_tests.rs only in this case.\nmod.rs\n\nThen by including that module in the top-level lib.rs and marking it as a test module, it will still get run as a unit test without cluttering up lib.rs itself.\nlib.rs\n\nAnd the results of running the unit tests when I do a cargo test:\n\nConclusion\nRust has been a great language to dig into a bit deeper, since it has some nice defaults, built in unit testing and the package and project management through cargo gets rid of a lot of boiler plate that I've constantly needed to duplicate across project for C++.\nThere are still some areas where I'm learning how to structure my code in a way that feels the most manageable and comfortable to me.  Given that the searches I did didn't show this solution published elsewhere, I hope others also find this useful.\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/020-rust-unit-test-layout/","title":"Rust unit test layout"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/021-nvim-is-awesome/":{"body":"I've recently switched from using Visual Studio Code as my main editor of choice to using Neovim with the awesome Astronvim configuration and some of my own tweaks on top. It ends up functioning as a great development environment with code hints, debugging, file finder and at the same time uses much less memory. It even has one killer feature over VS Code.\nBackground\nI had learned and used Vim a long time ago in college, when connecting over ssh to the school computers to do homework. I never felt quite comfortable using it as my main environment, but for the time (this was about 22 years ago), it worked well enough. I ended up preferring Visual Studio proper once I got out into the working world as I was doing C# programming at the time. When I moved to C++, I was still primarily working on Windows so Visual Studio Pro was still my go to.\nOnce Visual Studio Code came out, I jumped over to using it back around 2017 and have been using it ever since. It's a great editor and the extensions can be really powerful. I have however run into issues over time with memory load being too high, the electron base using GPU rendering draining more battery than simple text editing should and most recently lots of crashes from the Rust extension, apparently running out of memory in the background.\nAnother look at (Neo)Vim\nI occasionally like to look for new tools to make my workflow more efficient. Changing over to the Fish shell, using lcd as an ls replacement or bat instead of cat have been nice improvements. I stumbled onto the NvChad configuration about six months ago and played with it for a bit - it was really nice, but I just didn't take the time to dial everything in the way I liked. I kept it in the back of my mind though as it looked like a great tool for ssh'ing into a remote server or VM to work on.\nWith VS Code starting to give me occasional issues, I looked at NvChad again, but my config had somehow gotten out of date and was broken. Some searching around mentioned Astronvim and I decided to give it a shot. They had just converted to v3.0, using lazy.nvim as the plugin loader and out of the box, the experience is really good.\nWithin ten minutes, I had syntax highlighting and code hints for Rust and Elixir working, was able to pop open the file explorer, and was really liking the floating terminal window.\n\nKiller feature\nI had seen the Telescope plugin with NvChad before and really liked the fuzzy file finding, similar to VS Code's Ctrl+P feature. What I found this time was the Find Buffers version, default keymapping &lt;Leader&gt;+fb but more interestingly the Live Grep feature.\n\nWith Live Grep, I can start a Find in Files-style search, but easily move through the matches and see the context of the find. It also happens nearly instantly. When I've tried Find in Files with VS Code, it usually takes more than a couple of seconds, and the UX just feels slower.\nFor me, given some of the projects I've been working on which can span multiple repositories - so that simple project based symbol finding is not as useful - this was the feature that made me think \"Hmm, maybe I could replace VS Code with this now...\"\nAfter a number of little tweaks here and there to get the keybindings setup the way I like, I'm finding it more and more useful. In particular I found, thanks to a colleague, the vimwiki plugin, which has been the first major change to my note taking workflow in about a decade. I highly recommend trying it out (with my tweaks below of course 😄 ).\nMy Configuration\nAll of my tweaks are in a single user configuration file, which lives under ~/.config/nvim/lua/user/init.lua. I've placed my version here on Github (Obviously, that version may be more up to date than this article as I find more things to improve).\nLine Moving\nI really like the feature in VS Code of being able to move a line, or a set of lines with a control key and the arrow keys. Being vim, I've instead opted for the j/k style movement keys. It turned out that getting movement working in visual mode was being a pain, and some interactive help with ChatGPT sent me on a working path using lua functions instead:\n\nLine Duplicating\nSimilar to moving lines, I often find my self wanting to duplicate the current line up or down, or a selection of lines. I've grown accustomed to that workflow in VS Code, and it's a nice feature to have in Neovim as well. The following keybindings implement that feature:\n\nKey bindings for telescope\nI've gotten used to Ctrl+P looking for files, so I bound that to the Telescope plugin and also added Ctrl+B to search through the current buffer's list. I use Live Grep less often, so the default &lt;Leader&gt;fw is not too akward to rely on.\n\nBuffer switching\nBy default, Astronvim has &lt;Leader&gt;+[b and &lt;Leaader&gt;+]b as the bindings for switching between buffers (think open tabs). I ended up finding this a bit annoying to use in practice, so I changed my Terminal editor to use Win+Tab and Win+Shift+Tab to switch between terminal tabs leaving Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab open for switching buffers:\n\nEntering the Correct Directory on Startup\nOne thing I noticed was that if I start nvim from my home directory, giving it the directory to open, the file explorer would work, but neovim would still be in my home directory as its current working directory. This ended up messing with things like Telescope where I wanted to search starting from the directory I had opened. I had to do a similar tweak so that the floating terminal (bound to F7 by the way) would start in the correct directory as well:\n\nVisualizing whitespace\nI like being able to see whitespace, trailing and otherwise, and also wanted word wrapping to show a line wrap and indent a little bit. The following tweaks got that working:\n\nThe Rest of the Plugin Configuration\nAt the bottom of my user init.lua file, I include a number of AstroNvim community plugins and packs: rust, markdown, various colorschemes. I also modified the starting header, added mode text to the status line,\nThe community plugins and colorschemes portion looks like this:\n\nAdding vimwiki plugin\nFor vimwiki, I set it up so that it points to my local ~/code/tech-notes/wiki folder, setup the task completion characters to be:  ○◐●✓, and modified some key bindings so that I could use &lt;Tab&gt; and &lt;Shift+Tab&gt; for indenting and unindenting tasks:\n\nAs I mentioned, vimwiki has changed my note taking workflow, which has basically been unchanged for more than a decade. I usually use a simple text file with a header line for the current date, and a set of symbols (o, / and -) to mark a task as not started, in progress and completed. Now I have a nicer set of symbols with more fidelity and can use the shortcut Ctrl+Space to mark as fully complete, or with the following keybindings a bit higher up in the config file, I can use Ctrl+/ and Ctrl+\\ to move the status forward or backwards.\n\nVimwiki also has a diary mode, where you can open your entry for the current day with &lt;Leader&gt;+w,&lt;Leader&gt;+w which I've begun to use to start journaliing more regularly.\n\nConclusion\nNeovim with the AstroNvim configuration along with a handful of configuration tweaks has become my standard development editor for the last few weeks and I've found myself being just as, if not more, productive as my VS Code workflow which I've been using for at least five years. I have yet to even start using things like macros in earnest, so I see even more upside to using Neovim in the long term.\nI definitely recommend folks give the setup a shot and see if it works for them. Vim's mode based editing can take some effort to get used to, but besides some of those quirks, modern plugins make it a fantastic development experience.\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/021-nvim-is-awesome/","title":"Neovim with a Little Bit of Config is Amazing"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/022-shift-reg-multiplex/":{"body":"This time we'll continue from the last design article and add in the ability to drive multiple seven segment displays.\nArticle Series\n\nVerilog and State Machines\nSimulation and Build Tools\nSeven Segment Displays\nDocker Builds\nBuild System Updates, ECP5 Support\nTime-Multiplexed Seven Segment Displays\n\nDriving multiple displays\nSo we can drive a single seven segment display with only 3 pins of our FPGA using a shift register, but what if we want to have two or more displays? Do we need 3 pins for each? It turns out that since we can chain shift registers together, we can connect up multiple segments using just our same 3 pins.\nIn our first example, we'll daisy chain the segments together, so that each seven segment display is driven by its own shift register:\n \nBy chaining each register's shift out bit into the next register's data in bit, we effectively create a longer shift register.\nLooking in the 04_seven_seg_shift_reg_multi example, you can can see how this looks. The code is mostly the same as our 03_seven_seg_shift_reg example, except that we change some constants and add an extra hex to seven segment decoder module instance for the extra display:\n\nThe main changes to note:\n\nWe extended the size of the shift register module to 16 bits to accomodate having two seven segment displays\nWe setup our constants to use START_SEG_1_BIT to derive the other constants for the end of segment 1, and the start and end of segment 2's bits from our extended counter variable.\nWe also, as mentioned, added a second hex to seven segment decoder instance which is fed into the shift register with the other decoder instance to make up the 16 bits of data to shift out.\n\nIn our simulation code, everything is mostly the same apart from having an extra segment to display and some positioning code for the virtual seven segment display.\nIf you build and run the simulation you should see two segments counting up:\n \nBuilding the circuit\nBreadboarding out the circuit is straight forward, if not a touch tedious. You need resistors for each segment, so you end up with 16 of them plus the two displays and two shift registers.\nIf you follow the breadboard schematic above, you will end up with the following:\n \nIf you deploy the circuit, you'll see the digits couting up as you would expect:\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\nAnother Way: Time Multiplexing\nWhile we could just continue to daisy-chain multiple shift registers together with each one outputting to a display of its own, we would need one shift register per display, and each segment within a display needs its own current limiting resistor, which adds up. In some cases we may be more sensitive to part counts in our projects to complete our project. With less parts it will be cheaper to build and require less space.\nIf we want to have more seven segment displays but want the least number of components we can do something a bit clever and time-multiplex them. That just means we'll use one shift register for the current display value, and one shift register to round-robin enable each display in turn, one by one.\nSo, one shift register will show the currently enabled display's segments and the second shift register will act as an enable mask, with each bit being assigned to a different display. This allows us to drive up to eight displays with just two shift registers. Because only one display will be driven at a time, we can also get away with only eight resistors in total, rather than eight per display.\nThis works because the human eye can't perceive the quick on and off cycling as long as we cycle through the displays fast enough. The downside is of course that since we are switching between each display, there is less time that each display is actively on, and so will appear dimmer overall.\nFor the second shift register that controls which display is on, we'll use what's called \"one-hot\" encoding. This just means that we convert from the binary value of our counter rotating through which display should be on and create an enable mask where only one bit is on and all of the others are zero. It will end up looking like we shift a bit from the 0th position through to the nth bit position and then repeating.\nIn our case we will have the following encoding:\nCounterOne-hot Encoded Value\n00001\n01010\n10100\n\nWe can use that on/off signal to operate a transistor as a switch to selectively connect one display at a time. That means each display will now have a transistor in between it's common pin to accomplish this. In our case this common pin is the ground since I'm using common ground seven segment displays.\nIn our test circuit we'll set up 3 seven segment displays and so the first 3 bits of our control shift register will be the enable bit for each display in turn.\nOne-hot encoder design\nLet's start with the one hot encoder design as it's pretty straight-forward. We simply need to take in a counter value, 0 to 7, and output the bit that corresponds to that value, effectively mapping the 3 bit counter to one of 8 bits on the output.\n\nNotice here we're making use of the Verilog for loop construct. This is different than loops in procedural languages like C or C++, in that it is not designing a circuit that runs over clocks cycles, we do that ourselves with state machines as descibed in the first article.\nInstead, a Verilog for loop is more akin to a meta-programming construct in that it instantiates N iterations of the body in the actual circuit. The above is equivalent to us hand unrolling the loop and write each of the if({1'b0, i_val} == ii) ... statements by hand replacing ii with the current bit we are checking for.\nThe Time-Multiplexed Code\n\nThings to note in the code:\n\nThere is still a 16 bit shift register instantiated.\nWe now have a single hex to seven segment display encoder, which is used for the bottom 8 bits of our shift register value.\nThe top 8 bits of our shift register is filled with the value of the one hot encoder value\nOur counter logic resets the one-hot encoder value every six cycles - one cycle for each display to be on and one cycle in between to keep all of the displays off to mitigate the ghost digit display mentioned below.\n\nRunning the simulation, you'll see the digits counting up very fast so that we can see the third digit change in a reasonable amount of time:\n \nBuilding the circuit\nUsing NPN or PNP transistors as a switch.\nSo we have a signal from our one-hot encoder shift register to tell us whether a particular display should be enabled or not, but what does that look like on the circuit?\nWe can make use of a transistor as a switch. In this case I'm using Bipolar Junction transistors, so I connect my NPN ones up such that the collector is connected to the ground rail, and the emitter is connected to the ground/common pin of a seven segment display. The base is connected to the enable signal for that display, meaning that when that signal is low, the transistor won't allow current to flow, and when it is high it will. This lets us disconnect the seven segment display from the circuit by breaking its path to ground through the transistor as a switch.\n \nIssues I ran into\nGhost Digit Display\nOnce again, the simulation for this was working perfectly, but when I deployed the initial circuit, the display rather than looking solid, were blurry and seemed like there were ghost images. I knew the logic was doing what I wanted and I could see the values counting too so I knew there was something wrong at the electrical level.\nI first checked all of the connections, making sure that ground was properly connected and nothing was floating, but that was all fine. I tried switching out to different seven segment displays thinking maybe I had burned them out at some point: no luck. I tried using a MOSFET instead of a BJT and I still had the same problem.\nI had already checked the timing on the shift registers from the last article, so I was within bounds on the timing constraints there and so was at a loss of what was wrong after a few hours of fiddling around and trying different things (and also triple checking all of the simulation logic).\nI finally looked around the internet to see if someone else had done a similar project and found an article where the same type of multiplexing was being done but using an Arduino. Looking at the code in the article I noticed the one difference was that they had a full cycle where nothing was displayed on any of the segments in between turning each one on.\nChanging the one-hot encoder counter to switch off every other cycle fixed the problem completely! What was happening is that the encoder would swap the next display on, but there was still some current flowing from the old display register into the new one as it switched over to display its new value. The effect was that I got a ghost of the previous digit on the current digit's display. By giving the current digit some time to let the last digit value drop off, everything started working properly.\nOther Tweaks\nA couple of other tweaks I discovered helped the circuit work better, which means brighter and less flickering as we cycle through the enabled displays:\n\nI added a capacitor between the power rail and the power pin of the shift register. This is meant to help keep the power to the shift registers a bit more stable as we're quickly changing the amount of power each needs to source.\nI also used a resistor to connect the top common pin of each seven segment display to the bottom one. I originally used a wire to connect the two, but read on a forum that it could be safer to use a resistor.\n\nReviving the Breadboard Circuit Three Years Later\nI first built up this circuit about three years ago, and didn't get around to taking pictures for the article. When I tried to load the design again, the displays were dim and flickering. I probed the various power and ground rails to make sure the connections were good and found some flakey parts, probably some the wires being a bit short and having some build up over time that made the connections not too great. Cleaning up the wires a bit, swapping a few out and using a really fine sand paper to touch clean the connections on a few components did the trick.\nThe Time-Multiplexed Breadboard Circuit\n \nDeploying this, you should see the counter spanning across all three segments.\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\nNext Time\nThe plan for next time is to explain the UART serial receiver/transmitter that I built some time ago. I would say it will be up soonish, but I know how that turns out.\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/022-shift-reg-multiplex/","title":"FPGA design for Software Engineers, part 4 - Multiplexed Seven Segment Displays"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/023-zig-and-testz/":{"body":"Earlier this year I made the switch from using C++ on my hobby projects to trying out Rust. I spent about 6 months of hobby night-time programming time porting over my 2D game engine and the bulk of my 6502 CPU emulator project. There are a lot of aspects of Rust that are great, but I got tired of fighting the borrow checker left and right. I still feel like I have a hard time expressing myself in Rust.\nI had heard about and looked at the Zig programming language before and really liked some of its core concepts such as comptime for doing meta-programming in a much cleaner way than I've seen before. This was back when it was around 0.7 and it was pretty rough around the edges in many other areas though.\nI had another look towards the end of summer and found with version 0.11 it struck a chord with me and I've been using it ever since, getting further into a new porting exercise for my 2D game engine and 6502 CPU emulator in less than half the time it took me in Rust. I also wrote a small unit testing library for Zig called testz to improve my testing development flow.\nRust Pros and Cons\nRust is a great language and things like cargo and the trait system are really nice. I still think C++'s biggest failure is not having a comprehensive and default package manager yet.\nRust's trait system for defining interfaces and still allowing easy static method dispatch is a huge strength and something I'd like to see brought into Zig more explicitly.\nThe issue I found with Rust was that the borrow checker is trying to save me from problems that I personally just don't run into often enough to make it worth it.\nI tend to work on simple utilities and game projects for fun - if they crash it isn't the end of the world. For secure software development, I love the fact that Rust exists with its strong guarantees around memory safety. I just wish there was a laxer mode where I didn't need to pepper lifetimes around as much or needed to use awkward multiple layers of generics to express a simple shared link between data structures.\nAnd, no, wrapping everything in unsafe is not a real answer.\nThe zealotry of the community in Rust that you see in forums, although not something I've experienced myself directly, is an aspect that really turns me off of wanting to invest in the language as well.\nExample Rust Downside\nWhile working on my 2D game engine port in Rust, I wrote a tile map loader and renderer for Tiled maps. I had been working on my CPU emulator project for a while and had a decent grasp of things, but as soon as I ventured into slightly more interesting memory layouts and memory sharing schemes, like a list structure that needs to have references to a sibling list's objects, things got a lot more difficult much more quickly.\nIn a Tiled map, you have a bunch of tile Layers and they need to access a TileSet. A TileSet contains Tiles with properties that can be used in the layers so you can store attributes for your game, like if a tile should do damage, etc.\nGetting to the point of adding a function to the Layer to get a Tile object using the tile layer coordinate to look it up, took me around a week after getting all of the Tiled map XML parsing, lifetime handling and figuring out where to use Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt; to reference things properly between the Layer and TileSet (Here is an article with some more information on Rust's different memory structures for those interested). It wasn't too bad within the module itself, but once I wanted to expose an optional reference to the Tile to the user of the module, I had to jump through some hoops:\n\nIn this case, I explicitly only cared about single-threaded use, hence the Rc rather than an Arc. But, getting everything working in the larger module still took me about a week, as I mentioned, and I found myself simply not enjoying the project and struggled to stay motivated.\nSame Exercise in Zig\nTo break things up, I started playing with Zig, going through the ziglings exercises and making a couple of toy programs. Then I thought, I might as well do a port of my projects from Rust to compare the developer experiences.\nZig is trailing Rust in terms of tooling, and for example the package management is really new and was hard to get working. However since Zig is basically a better version of C, it gets rid of many of the annoying aspects of C++, adding some modern syntax sugar and nice new features of its own while still being open enough to let me express things more easily than in Rust.\nI found I didn't need and rely on tooling in Zig as much as I was doing in Rust and still managed to have a higher velocity. I also found I could simply refer to the online docs or even jump into the standard library code and actually understand things pretty quickly when needed. I don't typically go that route in other languages as it almost always seems more daunting, but in this case it's been pretty easy to look at the standard library on Github to answer any questions I have.\nWhile writing the equivalent XML parsing and rendering logic for Tiled maps, I managed to have a working module in about 3 hours. I ran into a single memory bug that caused a panic which took me about fifteen minutes to debug. I was returning a reference to a local variable that went out of scope and was easy to spot once I had the stack trace to look at.\nThe Zig version of the function above ended up looking like:\n\nWhen I'm somewhere around 10x more efficient at writing a module in a language I've only been playing with for a month versus a language I was learning for 6 months, there's clearly a learning cliff to Rust that makes it difficult for a developer coming from a C++ background. That friction will eventually cause people to push back against the language and look for alternatives.\nAreas Where Zig Can Improve\nThe ability to iterate quickly is really important, and Zig makes what I think is a mistake in making what should be warnings into errors. Two examples are unused variables and non-mutated variables needing to be changed to const. I would like a compiler flga or build option to allow me to turn off those errors or change them to just warnings - they may be code smells, but that doesn't mean I want to continually pause my development loop to fix them.\nAnother area is documentation and finding tutorials online that are still relevant. Out-of-date tutorials come from the fact that Zig is evolving pretty quickly and some larger breaking changes can come in making older blog articles no longer work out of the box. For example, in 0.11, the names of casting builtins got renamed, so @floatToInt became @intFromFloat. This isn't hard to deal with, but you stumble upon these sorts of issues from time to time looking at other blogs and it can be confusing.\nA third area for improvement is the zig test feature. Zig lets you embed unit tests in your modules, but I found the test output, ability to setup fixtures and setup tests in different files to not work the way I wanted. To that end, I created a small library I'm working on called testz which lets you set up a more traditional test program and run through functions you mark as tests. Another article I found, also details similar issues with how the builtin test functionality works.\nTestz Library\nThe library I wrote is currently pretty simple, but lets you discover tests by passing in modules where test function names end with Test. There are both simple and verbose output modes and you can skip test functions by prepending skip_ to a function. Being used as a simple executable means that fixture setup used across multiple tests is also quite easy.\nHere's what my summary output for unit tests for my 6502 CPU emulator looks like with testz:\n \nAnd the verbose output mode:\n \nThe nice part is that the work to discover tests and build up the list of functions to run is done at compile time and was relatively easy to get working. In other languages I've often needed to resort to external shell scripts or required more explicit setup by the user. Zig's comptime feature makes this really clean though.\nI didn't like how the stack traces looked using the builtin versions, but I was able to look at the code in the standard library and pull it out into a modified version that adds more context around each stack frame and ignores frames before the call to the test runner. This gives something like the following for a contrived assertion failure:\n \nThe library still needs a lot of touching up, like a proper ReadMe and more examples. I'll continue tinkering with it as time goes on.  Feel free to open an issue or reach out if you have a feature request pr find the library useful!\nIn the meantime I'll continue playing with my game engine and CPU emulator projects - they've proven to be meaty enough to really get acclimated to a new language.  Now I just need to actually write a game rather than rewriting the engine over and over 😆\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/023-zig-and-testz/","title":"Rust vs. Zig and testz"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/024-dev-sys-other-updates/":{"body":"Moving to Manjaro\nIt's been a while since I mentioned changes I've made to my development setup, the last being related to moving to Kubuntu from Windows 10, as well as moving to using NeoVim as my editor with AstroNVim as the base configuration.  I'm still going strong with NeoVim and loving it as my main editor (including on my phone and tablet via Termux!).  For the last few years though, I've actually been using Manjaro Linux, based on Arch Linux, as my OS and have been very happy with that setup.\nI use KDE as my desktop environmet, so apart from using pamac instead of apt to install packages from the command line, it's relatively transparent that I'm not using an Ubuntu falvor of an OS.\nThe issue I ran into was that at one point I was using an x.10 release of Ubuntu and held off on updating for a while.  As I've gotten older, I don't want to update a working setup unless I need to.  There's almost never anything in it for me to do a larger update.\nSince I had waited too long, the ability to upbdate Kubuntu through the normal dist-upgrade channel was turned off, so I was stuck and was going to have to reinstall the OS from scratch.  At that point, my brother mentioned to me that he had been trying various Arch distributions and liked Manjaro.  He's since moved on to EndeavorOS, which I may try sometime.  I gave Manjaro a shot and have had no problems with its rolling updates for over two years.\nIn the meantime, Steam on Linux has gotten to a point, where almost every title I want to play works on Linux without issues for me.  The one area that's still not perfect is with multiplayer games that use anti-cheat software like Battle Eye (Rainbox Six Siege, I'm looking at you).\nBlog Changes\nI recently swapped from using Hugo as my static site generator for the blog to using Zola.  My main gripe with Hugo was that I kept getting warnings about themes getting out of date as I would deploy and Hugo on Gitlab would build with a newer version.  I didn't really like how the themes in Hugo were setup, and this would have been the third time I went and hunted down a new theme to use that would be warning free.\nInstead, I had heard about Zola and thought I'd give it a try.  The theme engine, shortcode setup and content layout feel far cleaner to me.  That said, I setup my Hugo blog years ago, so maybe things had improved, but since this is just a place for me to publish ideas and articles I don't want to spend much if any time on maintaining my configuration - that takes away from the little time I spend blogging, adding another hurdle.\nOne big difference in Zola is being able to put my images in the same place as the post.  In Hugo I always had the images under the static folder, which kept them far from the posts where they're used.  Just like in code, this ends up being a bad idea.  Again, maybe this was user error, but Zola was setup perfectly right out of the box with good docs.\nWhile working to convert things over, I stumbled on this article: Why I chose Zola to build this site, where the author had a lot of the same issues with Hugo that I had.\nConverting my blog over to Zola from Hugo and changing over to hosting it on GitHub took about a day and was actually pretty fun.  I also have a feeling this will be a more stable setup, which may actually encourage me to write more.\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/024-dev-sys-other-updates/","title":"My Development System and Other Blog Updates"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/about/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/about/","title":"About"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/archive/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/archive/","title":""},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/blog/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/blog/","title":""},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/images/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/images/","title":""},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/offline/":{"body":"Offline Mode\nSorry, no cache found and it looks like you’re offline, a connection is required.\n","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/offline/","title":"Offline Mode"},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/pages/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/pages/","title":""},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/privacy/":{"body":"Privacy\n\nThis site does not set or use cookies.\nThis site does not store data in the browser to be shared, sent, or sold to third-parties.\nNo personal information is shared, sent, or sold to third-parties.\n\nEffective Date: 1st Jan 2022\n","description":"This page outlines the Privacy Policy for this site, and the date at which this policy was put into affect.","id":"https://www.walknsqualk.com/privacy/","title":"Privacy Policy"}},"docInfo":{"https://www.walknsqualk.com/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/000-welcome-to-the-blog/":{"body":123,"description":0,"title":2},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/001-setting-up-hugo-blog-on-gitlab/":{"body":184,"description":0,"title":6},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/002-hacking-final-fantasy-1-on-nes/":{"body":962,"description":0,"title":5},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/005-elixir-on-wsl/":{"body":265,"description":0,"title":4},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/006-phoenix-fallback-controller-note/":{"body":80,"description":0,"title":6},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/007-multiple-android-builds-xamarin-forms/":{"body":336,"description":0,"title":5},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/008-letsencrypt-with-hugo/":{"body":159,"description":0,"title":5},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/009-learning-japanese-kanji/":{"body":396,"description":0,"title":3},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/010-classic-techbooks-at-archive-org/":{"body":317,"description":0,"title":5},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/011-wx-sfml/":{"body":243,"description":0,"title":6},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/012-passive-active-consumption-production/":{"body":288,"description":0,"title":4},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/013-bitfeld-widths-cpp/":{"body":192,"description":0,"title":4},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/014-fpga-start/":{"body":2067,"description":0,"title":9},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/015-fpga-start2/":{"body":1318,"description":0,"title":9},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/016-fpga-start3/":{"body":1708,"description":0,"title":9},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/017-kubuntu/":{"body":615,"description":0,"title":5},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/018-fpga-docker-build/":{"body":270,"description":0,"title":6},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/019-fpga-build-updates/":{"body":533,"description":0,"title":9},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/020-rust-unit-test-layout/":{"body":227,"description":0,"title":4},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/021-nvim-is-awesome/":{"body":775,"description":0,"title":5},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/022-shift-reg-multiplex/":{"body":1073,"description":0,"title":10},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/023-zig-and-testz/":{"body":911,"description":0,"title":4},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/024-dev-sys-other-updates/":{"body":331,"description":0,"title":4},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/about/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/archive/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/blog/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/images/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/offline/":{"body":10,"description":0,"title":2},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/pages/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://www.walknsqualk.com/privacy/":{"body":26,"description":9,"title":2}},"length":31},"lang":"English"}
